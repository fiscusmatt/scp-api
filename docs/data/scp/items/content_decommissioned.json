which SCP-2082-1 was cloned.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> Evidence of SCP-2082's anomalous capabilities is managed and contained by Site-43's Archives and Revision Section.</p>\n<p>SCP-2082-1 is contained in Site-43 Secure Outpost 11. The primary containment unit has been modified to accommodate SCP-2082-1's cryogenic properties.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2082 is an extinct subspecies of the animal known as the woolly mammoth (<em>Mammuthus primigenius</em>). When living, it had an average shoulder height of approximately 3 meters and weighed up to 6,000 kilograms. It has been extinct for approximately 4,000 years, with most of the population having died off 10,000 years ago.</p>\n<p>Analysis of the remains of deceased instances, as well as limited data gathered from breeding modern elephants within <a href=\"/scp-561\">SCP-561</a>, provides evidence for SCP-2082's anomalous properties. SCP-2082 instances generate a cryothermic effect around their bodies at all times. Within the area of this effect, the temperature will swiftly drop, typically reaching a low point of -50\u00a0\u00b0C within five minutes. The area of effect, as well as its severity, increases as an instance ages; at birth, the effect only reaches a few centimeters, but it will rise consistently until the instance reaches full maturity, extending its effects to approximately 250 meters, and an average temperature of -100\u00a0\u00b0C. This area will exude large amounts of ice and sleet from all solid surfaces, in a manner similar to <a href=\"/scp-649\">SCP-649</a>.</p>\n<p>SCP-2082-1 is a cloned instance of SCP-2082, created by the research leads for the anomaly, Dr. Charles Ascher and Dr. Maria Reyes, in a Site-43 secure outpost. The purpose of this was to research and test an experimental cloning method and its effects on various anomalous and non-anomalous entities.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img alt=\"2082%20equipment.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/calibri-s-mega-cool-art-page-it-s-mostly-just-icons-but-what/2082%20equipment.png\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>Outpost 11 observation deck.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2082.1:</strong> On June 16th, 2019, Dr. Ascher and Dr. Reyes logged their first successful attempt at cloning an instance of SCP-2082.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> Final check. Everything good on your end?</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Yep!</p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> Let's get going then. This is attempt 43, June 16th, 2019. Thus far we've succeeded in reverting the full structure of an SCP-2082 instance at an adolescent age. However, generated instances have not been able to survive past the initial cloning process. Our new strategy involves fully replicating the womb of an SCP-2082 instance to the best of our abilities. This will likely be able to stabilize the cloned egg and allow it to survive into birth.</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> May I do the honors?</p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> Go ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Five\u2026 four\u2026 three\u2026 two\u2026 one\u2026 zero!</p>\n<p><em>[Reyes flips a switch on the control panel, activating the cloning apparatus.

What are you seeing?</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> The life signs\u2026 <em>[She grins.]</em> They're stable. And not only that, it's entered the first stages of growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> <em>[Sighs with relief.]</em> Thank God. But we're not finished yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> <em>[Laughs at Ascher.]</em> Oh, come on! I'm sure you can squeeze in a bit of excitement between your brooding and sulking. We did it! And besides, look at the little guy! <em>[She holds up a display, which is showing a live feed of the embryo.]</em> Cute, isn't he?</p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> Yeah, alright. <em>[He smiles slightly.]</em> Look, see? I fit a smile into my schedule.</p>\n<p><em>[Ascher and Reyes both laugh.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> Anyway, uh, for the log. It looks like the clone's life signs are holding steady. As for whether it makes it to birth, we'll have to wait and see, but this is still a huge step forward regardless.</p>\n<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2082.2:</strong> On April 11th, 2021, the birth of the first cloned SCP-2082 instance was observed, and subsequently designated SCP-2082-1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> You ready?</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Yeah. Let's do this.</p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> Okay. Today we will be testing the birthing part of the apparatus. We're wearing these suits \u2014 <em>[Gestures to himself and Reyes, both wearing protective gear.]</em> \u2014 to protect us from the SCP-2082 instance's predicted effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> It's coming out!</p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> Oh! We're just in time!</p>\n<p><em>[Reyes holds her hands towards the opening. The flaps covering it open up as SCP-2082-1 emerges. Reyes grabs the instance and holds it in her arms.

Look at him!</p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> Any signs of abnormality?</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Aside from his anomalous effects, none so far. <em>[She attaches a vital monitor to SCP-2082-1.]</em> Heart rate, breathing, everything looks steady.</p>\n<p><em>[A few moments of silence pass.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ascher:</strong> I can't believe it.</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> We did it!

I just\u2026 wow.</p>\n<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>SCP-2082-1 was successfully delivered, and no major medical issues were found. SCP-2082-1 remains under the care of Drs. Ascher and Reyes, who are monitoring its growth and development. Any long-term side effects of the cloning process have yet to be determined.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2082.3:</strong> Various logs have been submitted to this file and to Site-43 leadership, as specific examples of SCP-2082-1's development.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-2082-1 age: 6 months</strong></p>\n<p><em>[Dr. Reyes is sitting next to SCP-2082-1, feeding it by hand.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> You know, I never really had a pet of my own. My mom was allergic to dogs, and my dad got his eye scratched by a cat once, so those two were out of the question.</p>\n<p><em>[Reyes begins petting SCP-2082-1.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> I begged my parents to let me have a gerbil or something small, but they always told me I'd lose it. When I got a place of my own, I did actually get a guinea pig\u2026 I lost him the next day. I hope he's doing alright, I didn't even get to name him.</p>\n<p><em>[SCP-2082-1 stands up and begins walking around, then turns to stare at Reyes.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Don't look at me like that, I'm sorry for worrying you.

These effects are difficult to suppress or hide, due to the area of effect not being hindered by material barriers, and are a danger to both the integrity of its containment and to any supervising personnel.</p>\n<p>Additionally, SCP-2082-1 is suffering an aortic aneurysm as a result of imperfections in the cloning process; regardless of any risk of a breach, termination of the entity remains advised due to ethical concerns. While a surgical operation on SCP-2082-1 has been considered, its properties would be both a hindrance and a danger to any personnel attempting to operate on the entity.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is preferred that the entity be terminated as soon as possible, to reduce containment risk and to allow it to decease painlessly, rather than undergo a risky medical procedure or potentially breach containment. <em>- Dr. C. Ascher</em></p>\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> As an equal partner on the SCP-2082 project, I am opposed to my colleague's ill-advised recommendation to terminate SCP-2082-1. The risk is not nearly as great as is claimed by Dr. Ascher, and while containment may grow somewhat more difficult over time, SCP-2082-1 is in no way hostile and has no desire to escape containment, further reducing the potential threat. While it would be unethical to let SCP-2082-1 continue suffering, it would also be unethical to intentionally terminate him, especially when there are other options.</p>\n<p>Attempting an operation on SCP-2082-1, while unusual due to his properties, would be the most preferred method of handling the situation. Intentional termination has always been considered a last resort by this department and the Foundation at large, and immense time and funding has been put towards maintaining and caring for anomalous beings; I see no reason why SCP-2082-1 should be considered an exception. <em>- Dr. M. Reyes</em></p>\n<p><sup>*Must be of level 3 clearance or higher.</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After one week, the Decom. Dept. gave an official ruling on the matter, documented below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To Drs. C. Ascher and M. Reyes,</p>\n<p>The manner by which this proposal came forward was unorthodox; while there are often disagreements between supervising personnel regarding decommissioning proposals, they are typically resolved prior to the proposal. This disagreement does not reflect poorly upon either of you, and we are more than willing to help resolve this debate. Rest assured we considered both sides of the issue completely. The termination of an SCP object, particularly a living and sentient one, is not something we take lightly, and is an action that is preferably avoided. Certainly the entity means no ill will, and unlike many other objects in containment, seems perfectly content to remain in its current state.</p>\n<p>However, this does not negate the concerns of Dr. Ascher. SCP-2082-1, regardless of its intentions, remains quite dangerous to nearby personnel. This risk can of course be mitigated, and we agree with Dr. Reyes in that the danger posed by the entity, under normal circumstances, is not as high as was initially claimed. However, these circumstances are exceptional. SCP-2082-1 presently suffers from a severe health issue which, left untreated, will most likely result in its death. Unfortunately, the cryogenic effects of the entity mean that operating on it would be nigh impossible. Performing a surgery would be a major risk to operating personnel, and the amount of protection required would severely limit the precision and efficacy of the procedure regardless. The risk here, and probability of failure, is too great for us to approve.</p>\n<p>Thus, we are left with a choice. Either terminate the entity now, or let it die (potentially painfully) of natural causes. With this in mind, we have solemnly come to the conclusion that the proper course of action is to decommission SCP-2082-1. We will be performing termination procedures in exactly one (1) week's time, on September 6th, 2022.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Dir. Calvin Bold, Decommissioning Dept.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2082.6:</strong> Log of filed requests regarding SCP-2082-1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Request:</strong> The reconsideration of SCP-2082-1's termination.</p>\n<p><strong>Submitted by:</strong> Dr. M.

Below is an abridged log of the incident, compiled from multiple security feeds across Site-43.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[BEGIN LOG]</strong></p>\n<p><em>[Location is SCP-2082-1's containment unit. SCP-2082-1 is sleeping when an individual wearing protective gear enters the unit. The lights turn on, and Dr. Reyes's face can be seen through the visor. Reyes walks to SCP-2082-1 and gently shakes it.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> <em>[Whispering]</em> Hey, buddy. It's time to wake up.</p>\n<p><em>[SCP-2082-1 stirs and stands up. It begins vocalizing slightly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Shhh!</p>\n<p><em>[SCP-2082-1 goes silent.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> We're gonna be moving somewhere else today. But I need you to be super quiet, okay?</p>\n<p><em>[Reyes guides SCP-2082-1 through the doorway and into the observation chamber. SCP-2082-1 attempts to eat some chips that had been left on a plate on the table, but Reyes pulls it away.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> We'll have time to eat later bud, I promise. Lots of treats, just for you.</p>\n<p><em>[Reyes and SCP-2082-1 exit the outpost and proceed to the outer fence surrounding Site-43 without incident. Upon reaching it, Reyes pulls out wire cutters and begins cutting through the chain link fence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> Almost there, almost\u2026</p>\n<p><em>[A spotlight from a nearby guardpost illuminates the pair of them. After a moment, the breach alarm goes off, alerting Site-43 personnel to their location. SCP-2082-1 cries out.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Guard:</strong> <em>[Through loudspeakers]</em> Halt! Stand down and surrender yourself and the anomaly, or we will open fire!</p>\n<p><strong>Reyes:</strong> No, no, no, no, come on!</p>\n<p><em>[Reyes finishes cutting through the fence and guides SCP-2082-1 through it. She and the entity begin sprinting away. Nearby guards open fire at the pair, but are unable to hit them. Security personnel arrive at the location of the breach shortly thereafter.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>[END LOG]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Site-43 personnel began pursuit, but were unable to locate SCP-2082-1. The above incident report was immediately filed, and available agents began searching the surrounding area.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2082.8:</strong> At 11:13\u00a0A.M., following the incident, agents found Dr. Reyes kneeling over the body of SCP-2082-1, in a wooded area roughly two miles from Site-43. Reyes was apprehended and SCP-2082-1, confirmed to be deceased, was secured. Due to its death, SCP-2082-1's anomalous effects have ceased.</p>\n<p>Dr. Reyes was subjected to disciplinary review, and was sentenced to one year of unpaid suspension and demotion to Level 2, as well as mandatory counseling with a Site-43 psychiatrist. Harsher punishment was initially considered, but ultimately rejected due to Reyes' otherwise clean record, as well as having been suffering clear emotional distress at the time.</p>\n<p>SCP-2082-1-D's object class has been updated to Decommissioned. Autopsy of the body concluded that SCP-2082-1-D suffered a ruptured aneurysm, resulting in its death. While the cause of the rupture is speculative, it was mostly likely caused by abnormally high blood pressure due to extreme stress during the attempted breach.</p>\n<div class=\"more-by-calibold\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0More\u00a0by\u00a0Calibold\u00a0+</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0More\u00a0by\u00a0Calibold\u00a0-</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:125%;\"><a href=\"/calibri-bold-s-mega-cool-author-page\">Calibold's Mega Cool Author Page</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>\u2014 SCP Articles \u2014</strong></p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\">\n<p><a href=\"/scp-7178\">SCP-7178</a> \u2014 A Thief In The Night<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-7179\">SCP-7179</a> \u2014 E is for Eternity<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-6469\">SCP-6469-D</a> \u2014 A BABY?????<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-2082\">SCP-2082</a> \u2014 <em>Elephas cryophilus</em><br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-6156\">SCP-6156</a> \u2014 Oh, Doug!<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-6579\">SCP-6579-D</a> \u2014 The Detective Killer<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-6900\">SCP-6900-D</a> \u2014 The House of Stars<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-5277\">SCP-5277</a> \u2014 What Can Go Wrong<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-5363\">SCP-5363-D</a> \u2014 Controlled Containment<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-3482\">SCP-3482</a> \u2014 fine mayor posters campaign by dado<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-5156\">SCP-5156</a> \u2014 monke<br/>\n<a href=\"/director-bold-s-proposal-j\">Director Bold's Proposal-J</a> \u2014 \"Guys, please don't read our SCPs \ud83e\udd7a\"<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-2693\">SCP-2693</a> \u2014 Fell Into The Well, Fell Into The Well, Fell Into The Deep Dark Well<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-5559\">SCP-5559-D</a> \u2014 The Great Ambrose Bake-Off!<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-3448-j\">SCP-3448-J</a> \u2014 Should Have Taken Him Sleeping<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-4456\">SCP-4456-D</a> \u2014 No One Expects The Spanish Decommission!<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-4745\">SCP-4745</a> \u2014 Spooky Scary Snowman<br/>\n<a href=\"/scp-4645\">SCP-4645</a> \u2014 Blackmailing Computer</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>\u2014 Tales \u2014</strong></p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\">\n<p><a href=\"/threatini\">OpusConfidant Wiki - SCP-4645 - Threatini</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/diary-of-an-existential-kid\">Diary Of An Existential Kid</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/responsible-promotion\">Responsible Promotion</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/friends-of-us-never-die\">Friends Of Us Never Die</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/truth-lies\">Truth Lies</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/a-team-you-can-maybe-trust\">A Team You Can (Maybe) Trust</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/happy-father-s-day\">Happy Father's Day</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/mission-decommission\">Mission: Decommission</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/a-bold-choice\">A Bold Choice</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/i-am-become-death\">I Am Become Death</a><br/>\n<a href=\"/ulysses-b-donkman-and-the-heinous-hitman\">Ulysses B.

The primary containment unit has been modified to accommodate SCP-2082-1's cryogenic properties.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-2082 is an extinct subspecies of the animal known as the woolly mammoth (//Mammuthus primigenius//). When living, it had an average shoulder height of approximately 3 meters and weighed up to 6,000 kilograms. It has been extinct for approximately 4,000 years, with most of the population having died off 10,000 years ago.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the remains of deceased instances, as well as limited data gathered from breeding modern elephants within [[[SCP-561]]], provides evidence for SCP-2082's anomalous properties. SCP-2082 instances generate a cryothermic effect around their bodies at all times. Within the area of this effect, the temperature will swiftly drop, typically reaching a low point of -50 \u00b0C within five minutes. The area of effect, as well as its severity, increases as an instance ages; at birth, the effect only reaches a few centimeters, but it will rise consistently until the instance reaches full maturity, extending its effects to approximately 250 meters, and an average temperature of -100 \u00b0C. This area will exude large amounts of ice and sleet from all solid surfaces, in a manner similar to [[[SCP-649]]].\n\n\n\nSCP-2082-1 is a cloned instance of SCP-2082, created by the research leads for the anomaly, Dr. Charles Ascher and Dr. Maria Reyes, in a Site-43 secure outpost. The purpose of this was to research and test an experimental cloning method and its effects on various anomalous and non-anomalous entities.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a> name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/calibri-s-mega-cool-art-page-it-s-mostly-just-icons-but-what/2082%20equipment.png|caption=Outpost 11 observation deck.]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2082.1:** On June 16th, 2019, Dr. Ascher and Dr. Reyes logged their first successful attempt at cloning an instance of SCP-2082.\n\n\n\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Final check. Everything good on your end?\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Yep!\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Let's get going then. This is attempt 43, June 16th, 2019. Thus far we've succeeded in reverting the full structure of an SCP-2082 instance at an adolescent age. However, generated instances have not been able to survive past the initial cloning process. Our new strategy involves fully replicating the womb of an SCP-2082 instance to the best of our abilities. This will likely be able to stabilize the cloned egg and allow it to survive into birth.\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** May I do the honors?\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Go ahead.\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Five... four... three... two... one... zero!\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes flips a switch on the control panel, activating the cloning apparatus. She observes the machine's diagnostics as Ascher observes the device itself for any signs of malfunction. A few minutes pass before Reyes speaks.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Ascher.\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Yes? What are you seeing?\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** The life signs... //[She grins.]// They're stable. And not only that, it's entered the first stages of growth.\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** //[Sighs with relief.]// Thank God. But we're not finished yet.\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** //[Laughs at Ascher.]// Oh, come on! I'm sure you can squeeze in a bit of excitement between your brooding and sulking. We did it! And besides, look at the little guy! //[She holds up a display, which is showing a live feed of the embryo.]// Cute, isn't he?\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Yeah, alright. //[He smiles slightly.]// Look, see? I fit a smile into my schedule.\n\n> \n\n> //[Ascher and Reyes both laugh.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Anyway, uh, for the log. It looks like the clone's life signs are holding steady. As for whether it makes it to birth, we'll have to wait and see, but this is still a huge step forward regardless.\n\n> \n\n> **[END LOG]**\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2082.2:** On April 11th, 2021, the birth of the first cloned SCP-2082 instance was observed, and subsequently designated SCP-2082-1.\n\n\n\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** You ready?\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Yeah. Let's do this.\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Okay. Today we will be testing the birthing part of the apparatus. We're wearing these suits -- //[Gestures to himself and Reyes, both wearing protective gear.]// -- to protect us from the SCP-2082 instance's predicted effects.\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** It's coming out!\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Oh! We're just in time!\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes holds her hands towards the opening. The flaps covering it open up as SCP-2082-1 emerges. Reyes grabs the instance and holds it in her arms. Frost gathers on her suit.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** He's so tiny! Look at him!\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Any signs of abnormality?\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Aside from his anomalous effects, none so far. //[She attaches a vital monitor to SCP-2082-1.]// Heart rate, breathing, everything looks steady.\n\n> \n\n> //[A few moments of silence pass.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** I can't believe it.\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** We did it! Ascher, we //did it//!\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes hugs Ascher, who grins.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** I can't\u2014 Wow. This is...\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Incredible!\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Yeah... I just- We actually did it, Reyes. It works, it all works.\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes begins crying, cradling SCP-2082-1 in her arms.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** I-I'm going to send our notes to the project leads. Wow. I just... wow.\n\n> \n\n> **[END LOG]**\n\n\n\nSCP-2082-1 was successfully delivered, and no major medical issues were found. SCP-2082-1 remains under the care of Drs. Ascher and Reyes, who are monitoring its growth and development. Any long-term side effects of the cloning process have yet to be determined.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2082.3:** Various logs have been submitted to this file and to Site-43 leadership, as specific examples of SCP-2082-1's development.\n\n\n\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2082-1 age: 6 months**\n\n> \n\n> //[Dr. Reyes is sitting next to SCP-2082-1, feeding it by hand.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** You know, I never really had a pet of my own. My mom was allergic to dogs, and my dad got his eye scratched by a cat once, so those two were out of the question.\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes begins petting SCP-2082-1.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** I begged my parents to let me have a gerbil or something small, but they always told me I'd lose it. When I got a place of my own, I did actually get a guinea pig... I lost him the next day. I hope he's doing alright, I didn't even get to name him.\n\n> \n\n> //[SCP-2082-1 stands up and begins walking around, then turns to stare at Reyes.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Don't look at me like that, I'm sorry for worrying you. Besides, I'd get in serious trouble if I ever lost you. Plus, you're pretty big. You can't just hide underneath a sofa or something like that.\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** //[Yells from outside the containment unit.]// Hey, have you gotten those readings yet? Project leads want them in an hour!\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** //[Sighs.]// Right. Sorry, you're not a pet, I need to stop treating you like one.\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes turns on her equipment and begins taking measurements. As she does so, SCP-2082-1 walks over to her, stopping a few inches away. After a few moments, it wraps its trunk around Reyes' waist.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** //[Laughs.]// Aww! Thanks, bud.\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes pats SCP-2082-1, before putting her equipment away. She walks towards the exit, but stops shortly before reaching it and turns towards SCP-2082-1.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?\n\n> \n\n> //[SCP-2082-1 trumpets through its trunk. Reyes exits the containment unit.]//\n\n> \n\n> **[END LOG]**\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-2082-1 age: 9 months**\n\n> \n\n> //[Dr. Ascher is performing a standard analysis of SCP-2082-1.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Alright, you. Looks like everything's checked out as normal. //[He shivers.]// Damn suits. Or maybe it's you. I dunno.\n\n> \n\n> //[SCP-2082-1 wraps its trunk around Ascher's leg. Ascher sighs and removes it.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Come on, don't do that. I just want to be in and out. //[He checks the logs.]// Area of effect is now... 15 meters.\n\n> \n\n> //[SCP-2082-1 trumpets and runs around its containment unit.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Look, Reyes will be in here tomorrow. I don't want to play, sorry.\n\n> \n\n> //[Ascher packs up his equipment.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Besides, I need to figure out what to do with you. Because I'm not sure establishing a half-kilometer wide exclusion zone around your containment unit is feasible.\n\n> \n\n> //[SCP-2082-1 walks over to Ascher and rubs its head against his leg. Ascher yelps and jumps away.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Don't //do// that! That's cold! It's always cold...

I got this for you! It's got some special sealant and it's custom-made, so it won't like, snap from the cold. You can, uh... play with it, like... kick it around or... //[She pauses briefly.]// Alright, it's just a ball, but I'm not actually sure what mammoths like to do for fun, so I figured you should have something for when we're not around.\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes tosses the ball to SCP-2082-1. The ball bounces off SCP-2082-1's head, and it begins walking towards the ball.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Yeah, see! We can play catch if you want. Here.\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes holds out her hands. After a moment, SCP-2082-1 uses its trunk to hit the ball roughly in Reyes' direction. She reaches out and catches it.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** There you go! //[She claps.]//\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes and SCP-2082-1 spend several minutes rolling the ball back and forth towards each other. Eventually, Dr. Ascher walks into the containment unit.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Oh! What's going on here?\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** We're just playing a little bit of catch. Want to join?\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Actually, I was looking for you, we need to compile our weekly report. Also, um, is the ball a good idea? It's just...\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Hey, it's fine! I figured he'd like something to do when he's alone. Plus, it's his birthday and all.\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** I mean... I just think we should have talked about it first. It's not a big deal or anything, but it's\u2014 it's still an SCP.\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Yeah, I know. But it's barely noon, we've got plenty of time to do those reports later, and he needs some entertainment. //And//, you deserve some fun too. //[She pats the ground next to her.]// Come on, just for a bit? Please?\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Fine. //[He smiles slightly]// But even through the suit, I'm getting cold, so... I'm not gonna stay for too long.\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** No worries! It's nice to relax and hang out for a bit, the three of us. //[She pets SCP-2082-1, which trumpets softly.]// Look, we're just one cute little family!\n\n> \n\n> //[Ascher laughs. Reyes rolls the ball to him, and he rolls the ball to SCP-2082-1. After a few minutes, Ascher gets up and leaves.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Ah, well. I think he had fun, he definitely needs it. //[She scratches SCP-2082-1 behind its ears.]// Too much work, or maybe I'm just lazy. //[She pauses.]// I should probably go too, I //have// been slacking a bit lately.\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes stands up. SCP-2082-1 trumpets softly and wraps its trunk around her leg. Reyes gently strokes its trunk and removes it from her leg.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** I know, I'll miss you too. But it was fun! And I'll be back, I promise!\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes pats SCP-2082-1 and walks towards the door, waving to SCP-2082-1 as she exits.

Don't give me your sappy excuses! We both know how much you hated him! This isn't about ethics or efficiency or whatever, you're just being selfish and weak.\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Are you saying the only reason I'm suggesting this is because I //want// it dead? You really think I'm that petty? Do you know how much I struggled with even telling you about the update, because I knew it would break your heart? Let alone telling you what I thought the right thing to do was?\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** I've heard all your little asides about him, whining about how cold it is. Maybe you don't want to be a killer, but you definitely don't care enough to want to find another solution.\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** If you think that sending a team of heart surgeons into minus fifty degree weather is even feasible, let alone //approvable//\u2014\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** We're supposed to give up?

I'm sorry I have to say it, but someone has to keep their focus around here! Trying to save it will put too much at risk.\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Put //what// at risk? At the very, very worst, we fail to save him. And I'd hate that, I really really would, but at least then we would have //tried//!\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** And what about the doctors operating on it? Even if it's even possible to work at those temperatures, it would be too dangerous. And let's say, somehow, it all goes perfectly, we save it. Then we have a walking, growing snowstorm, just waiting to break out!\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** We'd move him, or //something//! Why are you so eager to give up?\n\n> \n\n> **Ascher:** Because I don't want anyone else to get hurt!

I don't want to kick you out. I won't make you leave.\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** That won't matter. Because if it's accepted, I'll leave the project myself.

Ascher, Dr. M. Reyes\n\n> \n\n> **Supporting Personnel*:**\n\n> * //Dir. H. Blank - Representing Site-43 Administration.//\n\n> * //Dr. K. Samson - Representing Site-43 Project Management.//\n\n> \n\n> **Please check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:**\n\n> \u2611 Excessively High Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario\n\n> \u2611 Excessive Danger\n\n> \u2610 Ability to Decom. Apollyon-Class Object\n\n> \u2610 Expense\n\n> \u2611 Ethical Concerns Over Necessary Containment\n\n> \u2610 Legal Concerns\n\n> \u2610 High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s):@@____@@)\n\n> \u2611 Other (please state):\n\n> \n\n> **Summary:** The area of effect of SCP-2082-1's anomalous properties is steadily growing, and expected to reach a maximum radius of 250 meters upon its reaching adulthood. These effects are difficult to suppress or hide, due to the area of effect not being hindered by material barriers, and are a danger to both the integrity of its containment and to any supervising personnel.\n\n> \n\n> Additionally, SCP-2082-1 is suffering an aortic aneurysm as a result of imperfections in the cloning process; regardless of any risk of a breach, termination of the entity remains advised due to ethical concerns. While a surgical operation on SCP-2082-1 has been considered, its properties would be both a hindrance and a danger to any personnel attempting to operate on the entity.\n\n> \n\n> Ultimately, it is preferred that the entity be terminated as soon as possible, to reduce containment risk and to allow it to decease painlessly, rather than undergo a risky medical procedure or potentially breach containment. //- Dr. C. Ascher//\n\n> \n\n> **Additional Notes:** As an equal partner on the SCP-2082 project, I am opposed to my colleague's ill-advised recommendation to terminate SCP-2082-1. The risk is not nearly as great as is claimed by Dr. Ascher, and while containment may grow somewhat more difficult over time, SCP-2082-1 is in no way hostile and has no desire to escape containment, further reducing the potential threat. While it would be unethical to let SCP-2082-1 continue suffering, it would also be unethical to intentionally terminate him, especially when there are other options.\n\n> \n\n> Attempting an operation on SCP-2082-1, while unusual due to his properties, would be the most preferred method of handling the situation. Intentional termination has always been considered a last resort by this department and the Foundation at large, and immense time and funding has been put towards maintaining and caring for anomalous beings; I see no reason why SCP-2082-1 should be considered an exception. //- Dr. M. Reyes//\n\n> \n\n> ^^*Must be of level 3 clearance or higher.^^\n\n\n\nAfter one week, the Decom. Dept. gave an official ruling on the matter, documented below:\n\n\n\n> To Drs. C. Ascher and M. Reyes,\n\n> \n\n> The manner by which this proposal came forward was unorthodox; while there are often disagreements between supervising personnel regarding decommissioning proposals, they are typically resolved prior to the proposal. This disagreement does not reflect poorly upon either of you, and we are more than willing to help resolve this debate. Rest assured we considered both sides of the issue completely. The termination of an SCP object, particularly a living and sentient one, is not something we take lightly, and is an action that is preferably avoided. Certainly the entity means no ill will, and unlike many other objects in containment, seems perfectly content to remain in its current state.\n\n> \n\n> However, this does not negate the concerns of Dr. Ascher. SCP-2082-1, regardless of its intentions, remains quite dangerous to nearby personnel. This risk can of course be mitigated, and we agree with Dr. Reyes in that the danger posed by the entity, under normal circumstances, is not as high as was initially claimed. However, these circumstances are exceptional. SCP-2082-1 presently suffers from a severe health issue which, left untreated, will most likely result in its death. Unfortunately, the cryogenic effects of the entity mean that operating on it would be nigh impossible. Performing a surgery would be a major risk to operating personnel, and the amount of protection required would severely limit the precision and efficacy of the procedure regardless. The risk here, and probability of failure, is too great for us to approve.\n\n> \n\n> Thus, we are left with a choice. Either terminate the entity now, or let it die (potentially painfully) of natural causes. With this in mind, we have solemnly come to the conclusion that the proper course of action is to decommission SCP-2082-1. We will be performing termination procedures in exactly one (1) week's time, on September 6th, 2022.\n\n> \n\n> Sincerely, Dir. Calvin Bold, Decommissioning Dept.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2082.6:** Log of filed requests regarding SCP-2082-1.\n\n\n\n> **Request:** The reconsideration of SCP-2082-1's termination.\n\n> \n\n> **Submitted by:** Dr. M.

Below is an abridged log of the incident, compiled from multiple security feeds across Site-43.\n\n\n\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n> \n\n> //[Location is SCP-2082-1's containment unit. SCP-2082-1 is sleeping when an individual wearing protective gear enters the unit. The lights turn on, and Dr. Reyes's face can be seen through the visor. Reyes walks to SCP-2082-1 and gently shakes it.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** //[Whispering]// Hey, buddy. It's time to wake up.\n\n> \n\n> //[SCP-2082-1 stirs and stands up. It begins vocalizing slightly.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Shhh!\n\n> \n\n> //[SCP-2082-1 goes silent.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** We're gonna be moving somewhere else today. But I need you to be super quiet, okay?\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes guides SCP-2082-1 through the doorway and into the observation chamber. SCP-2082-1 attempts to eat some chips that had been left on a plate on the table, but Reyes pulls it away.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** We'll have time to eat later bud, I promise. Lots of treats, just for you.\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes and SCP-2082-1 exit the outpost and proceed to the outer fence surrounding Site-43 without incident. Upon reaching it, Reyes pulls out wire cutters and begins cutting through the chain link fence.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** Almost there, almost...\n\n> \n\n> //[A spotlight from a nearby guardpost illuminates the pair of them. After a moment, the breach alarm goes off, alerting Site-43 personnel to their location. SCP-2082-1 cries out.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Guard:** //[Through loudspeakers]// Halt! Stand down and surrender yourself and the anomaly, or we will open fire!\n\n> \n\n> **Reyes:** No, no, no, no, come on!\n\n> \n\n> //[Reyes finishes cutting through the fence and guides SCP-2082-1 through it. She and the entity begin sprinting away. Nearby guards open fire at the pair, but are unable to hit them. Security personnel arrive at the location of the breach shortly thereafter.]//\n\n> \n\n> **[END LOG]**\n\n\n\nSite-43 personnel began pursuit, but were unable to locate SCP-2082-1. The above incident report was immediately filed, and available agents began searching the surrounding area.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Addendum 2082.8:** At 11:13 A.M., following the incident, agents found Dr. Reyes kneeling over the body of SCP-2082-1, in a wooded area roughly two miles from Site-43. Reyes was apprehended and SCP-2082-1, confirmed to be deceased, was secured. Due to its death, SCP-2082-1's anomalous effects have ceased.\n\n\n\nDr. Reyes was subjected to disciplinary review, and was sentenced to one year of unpaid suspension and demotion to Level 2, as well as mandatory counseling with a Site-43 psychiatrist. Harsher punishment was initially considered, but ultimately rejected due to Reyes' otherwise clean record, as well as having been suffering clear emotional distress at the time.\n\n\n\nSCP-2082-1-D's object class has been updated to Decommissioned. Autopsy of the body concluded that SCP-2082-1-D suffered a ruptured aneurysm, resulting in its death. While the cause of the rupture is speculative, it was mostly likely caused by abnormally high blood pressure due to extreme stress during the attempted breach.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/more-by:calibold\">:scp-wiki:more-by:calibold</a>]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-2081]]] | SCP-2082-D | [[[SCP-2083]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/calibri-s-mega-cool-art-page-it-s-mostly-just-icons-but-what/mammoth.jpg\n\n> **Name:** Mammuthus primigenius (baby woolly mammoth) (Late Pleistocene, 42 ka; Yamal Peninsula, Siberia, Russia) 1 (34834312015)\n\n> **Author:** James St. John\n\n> **License:** CC-by-SA 2.0\n\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mammuthus_primigenius_(baby_woolly_mammoth)_(Late_Pleistocene,_42_ka;_Yamal_Peninsula,_Siberia,_Russia)_1_(34834312015).jpg\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/calibri-s-mega-cool-art-page-it-s-mostly-just-icons-but-what/2082%20equipment.png\n\n> **Name:** Joensuu broadcasting station, equipment made in Yleisradio's workshop in Helsinki, 1938\n\n> **Author:** Archives of the Finnish Broadcasting Company Yle\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/ylearkisto/15484874051/\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/calibri-bold-s-mega-cool-author-page/SCP-2082.jpg\n\n> **Editor/Artist:** [[*user Dr Whitney]]\n\n> **Name:** Space Power Facility (SPF) - Disassembly Area\n\n> **Author:** Defense Visual Information Distribution Service\n\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\n> **Source Link:** https://picryl.com/media/space-power-facility-spf-disassembly-area-a10896\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n> **Filename:** https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/calibri-bold-s-mega-cool-author-page/SCP-2082.jpg\n\n> **Editor/Artist:** [[*user Dr Whitney]]\n\n> **Name:** Everybody Loves Babies\n\n> **Author:** Dennis S.

Taking into account [[[SCP-4051 | past malfeasance relating to humanoid anomalies]]], failure to decommission SCP-4175 will be seen as symptomatic of a misunderstanding of basic ethical practices persistent in Site-17 personnel, yourself included.\n\n> \n\n> - //Ethics Committee Liaison Jeremiah Cimmerian//\n\n\n\n[[/<]]\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\nAs of September 8, 2015, SCP-4175 has been declared Decommissioned.

If the new SCP-4456 instance is ever provided with approximately $519,000<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> in gold, silver, or gemstones, she will instantly disappear.</p>\n<p>If an SCP-4456 instance is not supplied with sufficient resources within twenty-four hours of manifestation, she will animate and become hostile, attempting to breach containment via ramming and on-board cannons.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 4456.1:</strong> During investigation into SCP-4456's origins, Foundation researchers discovered the following document, dating to circa 1500\u00a0C.E.:</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0Open\u00a0Document\u00a04456-A</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close\u00a0Document\u00a04456-A</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<p><em>Note: The following document has been translated from Spanish.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My Queen,</p>\n<p>I am filled with grief to report that the <em>Soy Mi Amante</em> has been struck down by unknown forces.

Her valiant crew would not speak of where they obtained their bounty, we only know that she carried much of it on her returns. I fear that her destruction may be the harbinger of some great and unknown force, which has tarried too long in its acceptance of our thievery. Perhaps even mightier forces are at play here, for it seems that no mortal entity could reduce such a mighty vessel as the <em>Soy Mi Amante</em> to mere ash in moments.</p>\n<p>May we pray that God has not taken wrath upon us, and that we continue to prosper under His grace.</p>\n<p>Your humble servant, Dante.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 4456.2:</strong> To determine where items placed on board SCP-4456 would go, ten silver coins, designed as exact copies were created and installed with microtrackers placed within each coin.

After every reproduction incident, the new SCP-4456 instance is to be provided with 2,500 pounds of pure silver.\n\n\n\n**Description (Archived):** SCP-4456 is an unmanned 16th-century Spanish galleon named \"//Soy Mi Amante//\"[[footnote]]I am my lover.[[/footnote]]. In terms of appearance, SCP-4456 is no different from ships of her model during the 1500s.\n\n\n\nEvery four to six days, an exact copy of SCP-4456 is generated in the nearest area of water that can hold her. If the new SCP-4456 instance is ever provided with approximately $519,000[[footnote]]Roughly 2,500 pounds of silver.[[/footnote]] in gold, silver, or gemstones, she will instantly disappear.\n\n\n\nIf an SCP-4456 instance is not supplied with sufficient resources within twenty-four hours of manifestation, she will animate and become hostile, attempting to breach containment via ramming and on-board cannons.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 4456.1:** During investigation into SCP-4456's origins, Foundation researchers discovered the following document, dating to circa 1500 C.E.:\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Document 4456-A\" hide=\"- Close Document 4456-A\"]]\n\n\n\n//Note: The following document has been translated from Spanish.//\n\n\n\n> My Queen,\n\n> \n\n> I am filled with grief to report that the //Soy Mi Amante// has been struck down by unknown forces. She and her crew will be remembered as the mighty bread basket of our holy kingdom.\n\n> \n\n> However, I must express my concern towards her former nature. Her valiant crew would not speak of where they obtained their bounty, we only know that she carried much of it on her returns. I fear that her destruction may be the harbinger of some great and unknown force, which has tarried too long in its acceptance of our thievery. Perhaps even mightier forces are at play here, for it seems that no mortal entity could reduce such a mighty vessel as the //Soy Mi Amante// to mere ash in moments.\n\n> \n\n> May we pray that God has not taken wrath upon us, and that we continue to prosper under His grace.\n\n> \n\n> Your humble servant, Dante.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 4456.2:** To determine where items placed on board SCP-4456 would go, ten silver coins, designed as exact copies were created and installed with microtrackers placed within each coin. After the coins had been placed aboard an SCP-4456 instance, the tracking receiver was activated, and immediately detected all Foundation coins in the //Museo Nacional del Prado//. Investigation revealed that the Museum had carried the coins since 1827.\n\n\n\nFurther research by the Anomalous Chronology Department found that every time a new SCP-4456 instance is provided with sufficient resources to disappear, the Spanish government's wealth would be retroactively increased by the value of the resources placed aboard the instance. While the exact repercussions of Foundation actions are inconclusive, it is widely speculated that the Foundation may have been at least partially responsible for Spain's Price Revolution[[footnote]]An economic recession during the 16th and 17th centuries, theorized to have been caused by the importation of silver from the Americas.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nDue to the large amount of money lost to SCP-4456, as well as the potential violation of laws outlined in the FIR Convention[[footnote]]Foundation International Relations Convention; carries guidelines for the Foundation's interactions with sovereign nations, including, in most cases, outlawing donations to other nations unrelated to anomalous containment.[[/footnote]], SCP-4456 is proposed for Decommissioning[[footnote]]The Decommissioned class has not been used for several years, due to the Foundation's focus on containing rather than destroying anomalies.

A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-GATEWAY) has been put in place to extensively monitor online discussion boards and flag possible descriptions of SCP-4659-1 instances or SCP-4659-2. An MTF unit is to evaluate these claims and determine by a case-by-case basis whether the issuing of amnestics is necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4659 refers to a series of videos which periodically manifested on the hardwares of various computers over an approximate period of 05/15/2005 and 06/27/2005. These videos, individually designated SCP-4659-1-1 through -12, manifested on an estimated 15 computers per video, and all appear to be operated and produced by one individual, hereafter designated SCP-4659-2.</p>\n<p>SCP-4659-2 is a vaguely humanoid entity which appears to reside in an extradimensional location currently unknown to the Foundation. Though it appears not to possess any means for visual observation, SCP-4659-2 demonstrates an ability to see, and instead of individual digits, SCP-4659-2 possesses seven small tendrils. Notably, SCP-4659-2 completely lacks facial features, save for a large, black spheroid structure in the middle of its face, which it vibrates to mimic the sound of human speech<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>The structure of most SCP-4659-1 instances<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> follow the typical format of an online film review.

Patterson<br/>\n<strong>Supporting Personnel*:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Senior Researcher James P. Sullivan</em></li>\n<li><em>Junior Researcher Eliza S. Hernstein</em></li>\n<li><em>Junior Researcher Zachary L. Browne</em></li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> At its current pace, SCP-4659 poses an imminent threat to the Foundation's veil of secrecy. The proliferation of SCP-4659-1 instances appears to be growing exponentially, and while the Foundation has been able to suppress much of the information about SCP-4659 both on- and off-line, the current growth trends signify an increasing difficulty of containment efforts and a possible lifting of the veil.</p>\n<p>The problems posed by SCP-4659 are twofold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unlike other anomalies which proliferate on the Internet, SCP-4659 directly manifests onto hardware, which does not easily register to Foundation webcrawlers or bots. While numerous computer models are able to have their hardware monitored by the Foundation (including IBM, Dell, and Apple), the growing variety of computer models leaves SCP-4659 vulnerable to discovery, and in some cases, spreading. In fact, current models estimate that 2-3% of all SCP-4659-1 instances are discovered without Foundation intervention. Combined with the possibility that dissemination of SCP-4659 can extend beyond hardware (as evidenced by a radio station in Willoughby, OH being intercepted to play the audio of an SCP-4659-1 instance), containment of SCP-4659 will soon become near-impossible.</li>\n<li>Unlike other anomalies broadcasted from extradimensional locations, the amount of production value which would have to go into fabricating SCP-4659 is close to unbelievable. Even if it were simpler to explain the content of SCP-4659-1 instances away as parody or satire, the method by which SCP-4659-1 instances are disseminated is difficult to easily justify.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As attempting to contain SCP-4659 in the two approaches explained above is proving to be sharply decreasing in expediency, we are therefore proposing that SCP-4659 be considered for decommissioning.</p>\n<p><strong>Method(s):</strong> In order to discourage the further production of SCP-4659-1 instances, we are proposing to attempt direct contact with SCP-4659-2 via its provided business email (which has since been deactivated to non-Foundation personnel) in order to convince it to terminate the creation of SCP-4659. Along with the execution of current containment procedures, planned course of action is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Demand the forced discontinuation of the production of SCP-4659-1 instances to SCP-4659-2 under the guise of:\n<ul>\n<li>Profane and obscene content</li>\n<li>Copyright infringement</li>\n<li>Harassment</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Should SCP-4659-2 be unwilling to comply with these requests, manufacture negative reception of SCP-4659 in emails directed towards SCP-4659-2.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our hopes are that this protocol will dissuade SCP-4659-2 from making new SCP-4659-1 instances due to an overwhelmingly negative reception. Further methods are to be discussed should either of these methods fail in the discontinuation of SCP-4659 production.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Sen.

A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-GATEWAY) has been put in place to extensively monitor online discussion boards and flag possible descriptions of SCP-4659-1 instances or SCP-4659-2. An MTF unit is to evaluate these claims and determine by a case-by-case basis whether the issuing of amnestics is necessary.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-4659 refers to a series of videos which periodically manifested on the hardwares of various computers over an approximate period of 05/15/2005 and 06/27/2005. These videos, individually designated SCP-4659-1-1 through -12, manifested on an estimated 15 computers per video, and all appear to be operated and produced by one individual, hereafter designated SCP-4659-2.\n\n\n\nSCP-4659-2 is a vaguely humanoid entity which appears to reside in an extradimensional location currently unknown to the Foundation. Though it appears not to possess any means for visual observation, SCP-4659-2 demonstrates an ability to see, and instead of individual digits, SCP-4659-2 possesses seven small tendrils. Notably, SCP-4659-2 completely lacks facial features, save for a large, black spheroid structure in the middle of its face, which it vibrates to mimic the sound of human speech[[footnote]]Though its main language appears to be a guttural language as-of-yet undeciphered to the Foundation, SCP-4659-2 is also fluent in English.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nThe structure of most SCP-4659-1 instances[[footnote]]At times, SCP-4659-2 will produce an unstructured video addressing certain events in its life.[[/footnote]] follow the typical format of an online film review. At the beginning of each of these videos, SCP-4659-2 will shortly introduce the film[[footnote]]Notably, none of the films reviewed by SCP-4659-2 have corresponded to any films in our world.[[/footnote]] that it will be reviewing, usually in an exaggerated manner. For the middle portion of the video, footage of the film in question will be interspersed with various comments made by SCP-4659-2 about the film, typically for comedic effect. This middle portion continues for an average of 5-6 minutes, after which SCP-4659-2 will summarize its opinion of the film before ending the video with a plea to continue watching its content along with a link to its email for future video suggestions[[footnote]]Email since discontinued.[[/footnote]], the only known means of communication with SCP-4659-2.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 4659.1:** Excerpt from SCP-4659-1-2\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"\u25b6 ACCESS scpfn://4659/videos/1.2.log\" hide=\"\u25b7 CLOSE VIDEO LOG\"]]\n\n\n\n> = [[size 140%]]**VIDEO LOG EXCERPT OF SCP-4659-1-2**[[/size]]\n\n> ----\n\n> **Instance Title:**[[footnote]]Derived from the filename of the video at time of manifestation.[[/footnote]] \"Captain of Agvofala\" Review\n\n> \n\n> **Duration:** 08:31\n\n> ----\n\n> = **{{[BEGIN LOG]}}**\n\n> \n\n> //The video begins at a shot of SCP-4659-2 up to its waist.

Patterson\n\n**Supporting Personnel*:**\n\n* //Senior Researcher James P. Sullivan//\n\n* //Junior Researcher Eliza S. Hernstein//\n\n* //Junior Researcher Zachary L. Browne//\n\n----\n\n**Proposal:** At its current pace, SCP-4659 poses an imminent threat to the Foundation's veil of secrecy. The proliferation of SCP-4659-1 instances appears to be growing exponentially, and while the Foundation has been able to suppress much of the information about SCP-4659 both on- and off-line, the current growth trends signify an increasing difficulty of containment efforts and a possible lifting of the veil.\n\n\n\nThe problems posed by SCP-4659 are twofold:\n\n\n\n# Unlike other anomalies which proliferate on the Internet, SCP-4659 directly manifests onto hardware, which does not easily register to Foundation webcrawlers or bots. While numerous computer models are able to have their hardware monitored by the Foundation (including IBM, Dell, and Apple), the growing variety of computer models leaves SCP-4659 vulnerable to discovery, and in some cases, spreading. In fact, current models estimate that 2-3% of all SCP-4659-1 instances are discovered without Foundation intervention. Combined with the possibility that dissemination of SCP-4659 can extend beyond hardware (as evidenced by a radio station in Willoughby, OH being intercepted to play the audio of an SCP-4659-1 instance), containment of SCP-4659 will soon become near-impossible.\n\n# Unlike other anomalies broadcasted from extradimensional locations, the amount of production value which would have to go into fabricating SCP-4659 is close to unbelievable. Even if it were simpler to explain the content of SCP-4659-1 instances away as parody or satire, the method by which SCP-4659-1 instances are disseminated is difficult to easily justify.\n\n\n\nAs attempting to contain SCP-4659 in the two approaches explained above is proving to be sharply decreasing in expediency, we are therefore proposing that SCP-4659 be considered for decommissioning.\n\n\n\n**Method(s):** In order to discourage the further production of SCP-4659-1 instances, we are proposing to attempt direct contact with SCP-4659-2 via its provided business email (which has since been deactivated to non-Foundation personnel) in order to convince it to terminate the creation of SCP-4659. Along with the execution of current containment procedures, planned course of action is as follows:\n\n\n\n# Demand the forced discontinuation of the production of SCP-4659-1 instances to SCP-4659-2 under the guise of:\n\n\u00a0* Profane and obscene content\n\n\u00a0* Copyright infringement\n\n\u00a0* Harassment\n\n# Should SCP-4659-2 be unwilling to comply with these requests, manufacture negative reception of SCP-4659 in emails directed towards SCP-4659-2.\n\n\n\nOur hopes are that this protocol will dissuade SCP-4659-2 from making new SCP-4659-1 instances due to an overwhelmingly negative reception. Further methods are to be discussed should either of these methods fail in the discontinuation of SCP-4659 production.\n\n\n\n-- Sen.

It is apparent that the current efforts put in place have significantly exacerbated efforts of containment; therefore, we are proposing several revisions to the decommissioning protocol.\n\n\n\n**Method(s):** Given that SCP-4659-2 has been invariably hostile to any directly negative feedback, and given that SCP-4659-2 has at numerous times asked for constructive criticism of SCP-4659 from its followers, we therefore propose the following course of action:\n\n\n\n# While posing as followers of SCP-4659, offer faulty advice to SCP-4659-2 about how it can improve future SCP-4659-1 instances. Current proposals for advice center around components which are more difficult to fulfill, such as:\n\n\u00a0* Producing longer videos\n\n\u00a0* Including more visual aids\n\n\u00a0* Utilizing more props and clothing\n\n# While still under the guise of SCP-4659 followers, issue negative feedback about the newly produced SCP-4659-1 instances.\n\n\n\nOur hopes for this new protocol are that, in discovering the adverse appraisal from its supposed followers, SCP-4659-2 will become dissatisfied in making newer SCP-4659-1 instances due to its negative reception.\n\n----\n\n**Submission Consensus (DD):** RATIFIED ##green| \u25cf## (3-2-2)\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n^^//* Must be of level 3 clearance or higher.//^^\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 4659.5:** Excerpt from SCP-4659-1-12\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"\u25b6 ACCESS scpfn://4659/videos/1.12.log\" hide=\"\u25b7 CLOSE VIDEO LOG\"]]\n\n\n\n> = [[size 140%]]**VIDEO LOG EXCERPT OF SCP-4659-1-12**[[/size]]\n\n> ----\n\n> **Instance Title:** DISSECTOR REVIEWS EPISODE 8: \"TIME AND TIME AGAIN\"\n\n> \n\n> **Duration:** 19:43\n\n> \n\n> **Foreword:** At this point, a week prior to the release of this video, the Foundation had issued numerous emails to SCP-4659-2 per decommissioning protocol.\n\n> ----\n\n> = **{{[BEGIN LOG]}}**\n\n> \n\n> //The video begins with SCP-4659-2 seated at a table, dressed in a crudely constructed outfit composing of green, blue, red, and black chunks of fabric.//\n\n> \n\n> **SCP-4659-2:** //(Shouting)// Hi all, it's me, the Dissector.

Examination requires permission from Dr. Sorenson.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-4679 was an entity of unknown origin active in the United Kingdom between 1986 and 2019. As of time of writing, it is an amorphous collection of undifferentiated cells, approximately one tonne in weight. Prior to decommissioning it was incorporeal. It was an oneiric hunter, latching onto one person at a time and consuming them over a period of approximately twenty-four weeks.</p>\n<p>Five stages have been identified as universal to its hunting process. These are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> SCP-4679 latches onto its victim. Victims report unusually vivid dreams, but no other observable symptoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Moderate to severe pains occur in the victim, as well as headaches and night sweats. Victims report dreams taking place in near total darkness, although the content is otherwise unremarkable.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> In addition to aforementioned symptoms, victims report moderate to severe fatigue, nausea and light-headedness. They also display a low red blood cell count, and as such this is usually the stage at which civilian cases are identified. Dreams now include an entity, believed to be a representation of SCP-4679, which stalks the victim, although they often experience no unease regarding it.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Fatigue becomes extreme, with victims often unable to leave their beds. Sleep paralysis is common. Activity in the thalamus is greatly reduced at this stage. Dream content is difficult to ascertain at this point, but seems to commonly involve the entity consuming parts of the victim's body, although again, they do not seem perturbed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stage 5:</strong> Victims become fully comatose. Brain activity becomes negligible. No victims have recovered from this state. At time of writing, 387 people in Stage 5 are in Foundation care, with more believed to exist unidentified in the general population.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Much of the information on earlier stages comes from the 340 Foundation staff members affected by SCP-4679 since its discovery.</p>\n<p>Due to the entity's uncontainable nature, as well as its consistent detrimental impact on Foundation personnel, efforts to decommission it were authorised. See Addenda for further detail.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 7:</strong> Junior Researcher Claire Halloway was identified as a Stage 3 victim of SCP-4679, and as such was chosen as the decommissioning vector. Procedure 220-Maxtible was the experimental dream manipulation method designed to decommission SCP-4679; it would introduce elements believed to be inimical to oneiric hunters, based on experiences with other such entities. Halloway was the first subject to undergo this procedure. She was granted extended leave for the duration, and was instructed to remain within Site 135 under observation.</p>\n<p>Dr. Valerie Whitaker was chosen to liason between Junior Researcher Halloway and the team carrying out Procedure 220-Maxtible. She was to record Halloway's dreams and report them.</p>\n<p>Below is a log of the first session, prior to the beginning of the procedure, in which Halloway recounts a typical Stage 3 dream. Her speech is written in standard text. Dr. Whitaker's is in <em>italics</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>How are you feeling?</em></p>\n<p>Fine.</p>\n<p><em>There's no need for small talk. Be honest.</em></p>\n<p>I am. I feel fine. Well, as fine as I ever do. Everyone says this'll work, and I'll be fine. I trust them.</p>\n<p><em>That's a brave way to look at it.</em></p>\n<p>Don't patronise me. Not like I have any control over that, is it?</p>\n<p><em>I'm really not. Shall we begin, then?</em></p>\n<p>Okay.</p>\n<p><em>I've read your notes. Try to connect them a bit. Be as clear as you can.</em></p>\n<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>\n<p>It's dark. No, it's not, it's\u2026 it's <em>mostly</em> dark. There's moonlight. I think. It's hard to tell.</p>\n<p><em>Go on.</em></p>\n<p>I think I'm outside. The floor is pavement. I start walking. Don't know where, just\u2026 walking. Away. I can see my shadow in front of me, that's about it. Then it turns into another shadow. Blurry, indistinct. There's something else walking behind me, bigger than me.</p>\n<p><em>Do you know what it is?</em></p>\n<p>Honestly, I\u2026 don't really care. It feels like it's supposed to be there. Not like a friend, like\u2026 like a table you've had for years. I dunno. Anyway, we keep walking, and then I, uh, walk up into the air. Like I'm going up invisible stairs. Keep walking, higher and higher.</p>\n<p>When I look up, I can see the moon. It's massive, way bigger than it should be. Kinda cool, actually. I keep walking, up and up, closer and closer. Stretch my arm out, it's so close, and\u2026</p>\n<p><em>And then?</em></p>\n<p>And then I wake up in a puddle of sweat. Very elegant, right?</p>\n<p><em>Alright. Thank you, Claire. Would you say that's a fairly typical dream, of late?</em></p>\n<p>More or less. Is that\u2026 good or bad? Like, going from other cases?</p>\n<p><em>Hard to say, unfortunately.</em></p>\n<p>Mm.</p>\n<p><em>They're just refining the procedure. Should get started before next week.</em></p>\n<p>Good. Let's get on with it.</p>\n<p><em>I didn't realise you were so keen.</em></p>\n<p>I'm keen not to have my brain eaten by a murder monster. They've made it abundantly clear that this is gonna suck, but it's better than the alternative. I mean, this <em>will</em> work, right? You're sure?</p>\n<p><em>As sure as we can be.</em></p>\n<p>Okay. Okay. Guess I shouldn't doubt you lot, then. Yeah, few weeks of suffering, then back to actual work. No problem.</p>\n<p><em>That's a good attitude to have.</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, I refuse to die from this. Got too much to do.</p>\n<p><em>Attagirl.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum 12:</strong> Log of session between Dr. Whitaker and Junior Researcher Halloway. First reported dream following implementation of Procedure 220-Maxtible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm in a forest. I don't recognise it - I can barely <em>see</em> it, it's pitch black. I'm in my pyjamas, it's freezing, but it's silent. I don't even remember hearing the trees rustle, but there's no leaves to rustle anyway.</p>\n<p>Actually, it's not pitch black. More like dusk, there's just a few hints of sunlight. It's mostly dark, though. I \u2014 hmm.</p>\n<p><em>What is it?</em></p>\n<p>The sun. It's \u2014 I'm not scared. Uncomfortable. I don't like the darkness, but it's better than the light.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't matter, because there's something there with me. I can't see or hear it, but I know it's there. If I turn around, I'll see it, but\u2026 I can't do that. Don't ask why, I don't fucking know, but th \u2014 in that moment, everything screams at me not to.</p>\n<p>The bushes and stuff have gotten thicker, out of nowhere, like, but I guess that's dreams for you. They keep snagging on me, and I try to push past them but they're slowing me down, and it's still coming, and-</p>\n<p><em>Take a breath. You're safe here.</em></p>\n<p>\u2026It's just\u2026 too much. It's getting closer, I <em>know</em> it is, and these fucking branches just won't let me through. And then I trip.</p>\n<p>Eyes shut straight away, I can't look at it, but I can feel it touching me, it's warm, and it fucking hurts. My face is screwed up so tight, my hands are covering it, and then it's covering my face too. And\u2026 then it starts raining.</p>\n<p>All of a sudden, there's this\u2026 screaming. And the sun comes through the trees. No \u2014 well, yes, it <em>is</em> the sun, but it's too bright, too white. And it's searing hot, I open my eyes out of reflex, but the\u2026 <em>thing</em> is gone. Still screaming. I put my hand out to catch the rain, and it pools in my hand, and it's not rain. It's metal, silver. No, mercury.</p>\n<p>I turn to the left and look in the mirror. I'm crying mercury. It's leaking from my eyes, my nose, my mouth, I'm drowning in it, and I feel myself\u2026 crystallise? Yeah, I know how daft it sounds, but I know right there and fucking then how fragile I am, like I'll shatter into a million pieces at the slightest touch. And the mercury is still fucking streaming out of me, it's burning so much, I stagger back, trip over something, and as I'm going I know I'm going to break \u2014</p>\n<p>And then I woke up.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>So, is this just what it's gonna be like now, then?</p>\n<p><em>I'm afraid so. How do you feel?</em></p>\n<p>Dreamy.</p>\n<p><em>Very funny.</em></p>\n<p>\u2026tired. Light-headed. Bit nauseous. Pretty much what I expected.</p>\n<p><em>I'm sorry.</em></p>\n<p>Hey, at least it's <em>for</em> something. Had my share of hangovers, felt worse for no reason. There's a goal to this, right?</p>\n<p><em>Right.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum 22:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Hey - whoa, are you alright?</em></p>\n<p>I - oh -</p>\n<p><em>Okay, just - try to hold it in, let me grab the bin, there -</em></p>\n<p><em>That's better. Let it all out.</em></p>\n<p>- ugh. Fuck.

That all?</p>\n<p><em>It's not as long as you'd think.</em></p>\n<p>Says the woman on the other side of the table.</p>\n<p><em>Fair enough. When you're ready, then.</em></p>\n<p>Okay. Yeah. Uh, I'm in a boat. Little wooden one, drifting. The sea's red.</p>\n<p><em>Blood?</em></p>\n<p>I don't know. I'm not scared of it. Yeah, um, I'm lying back, and there's a drip in my arm. Like, an IV. Not sure what's in it, but the liquid's silver.</p>\n<p>The sun is\u2026 beating down. It's baking hot. Suffocating. I feel sluggish, like I can barely move. Barely breathe. The air's all shimmery, everything's all blurry, out of focus, and - and - ohfuck -</p>\n<p><em>Do you need the bin ag- okay, yes, you do.</em></p>\n<p><em>Are you going to be alright?</em></p>\n<p>Would it matter if I said no?</p>\n<p><em>It would to me.</em></p>\n<p>Ugh. I mean, uh\u2026 shit, sorry, I do appreci-</p>\n<p><em>You have nothing to apologise for.</em></p>\n<p>Hmph.</p>\n<p>There's something at the front of the boat. Indistinct, but I don't know if that's just it or it's because I can't see shit. It's small, curled up. Whimpering. There's a tube from the IV leading to it, too. No needle though, it just looks like it's been rammed in. Blood's all crusted around where it goes in, that's clear at least.</p>\n<p>Sorry, just\u2026</p>\n<p><em>I've got some Nurofen, if you-</em></p>\n<p>Not allowed it. Fucks with the magic, apparently, God only knows why.</p>\n<p><em>Hm. Let me email Dr. Afolayan, I'm sure he'll know what you can take.</em></p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p><em>You're doing very well under the circumstances, you know.</em></p>\n<p>Hmph. I'm gonna be alright, aren't I? Not much point in moaning.</p>\n<p><em>There's every point in moaning, if you need to.</em></p>\n<p>Mm.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>I'll just\u2026 carry on, then.</p>\n<p><em>If you're up to it.</em></p>\n<p>Yeah. It's, uh, it's weird, I know this thing is\u2026 well, I know what this thing is. Still, looking at it there, all small, it's kind of\u2026 pitiful? I mean, let's be honest, this thing's killed a fuckload of people, and it's struggling with <em>me</em>? Heh, come on.</p>\n<p>But I can't look at it anymore. Not like before, I don't feel like something awful will happen if I do, I just\u2026 can't. But at the same time I\u2026 pull towards it. The drip comes with me, I'd forgotten about it, actually. I find myself reaching towards it. My hand gets so close. And it's scared, actually scared, I can feel it.</p>\n<p><em>And then?</em></p>\n<p>And then I wake up feeling like death and stagger to you.</p>\n<p><em>Ah. I wasn't going to bring up the pyjamas.</em></p>\n<p>Shut up, my mum likes the Muppets.</p>\n<p><em>I'm sure. Oh, Alfred's gotten in touch. You can have paracetamol, at least.

The hallway's too wide, but I don't really notice Windows are boarded up or something, I can't tell if it's night or day.</p>\n<p>I end up in the infirmary. It's pretty much empty, but there's one bed occupied, covered with a sheet. I don't go near it. There's a door on the other side that shouldn't be there, so I go through, but I come out back in the infirmary, the way I came in the first time. Try again a few times, same thing happens. Try to leave the other way, shock horror, I come in through the other door.</p>\n<p>Not sure how long that goes on. Way too long. So I sit on one of the beds and start pulling the pillow apart. I can feel the bed behind me, staring at me, but like fuck am I going near there. Until I've been sat there for\u2026 I have no idea. Too long. But there's no other way out.</p>\n<p>It's, uh, me. Under the sheet, I mean. It's me. Not sure if I - she's alive or, um, y'know, but her eyes are open. Blank. Silver. It's like tear stains down my face, except they're burned in, like I was crying acid. I try to close my - her eyes, but the skin flakes away in my hand, like I'm running my finger across an old fireplace or something. The veins are weird, prominent. I touch one, just to see, and it collapses, cuts through the skin. Take a wild fucking guess what leaks out.</p>\n<p>No idea why, but I grab the bed, try to wheel it away. The two doors are gone, just holes in the wall. I can see the red emergency lighting through the one that shouldn't be there. Just black, the other way. I push myself toward the red door.</p>\n<p>Something drags me back. I don't sense, uh, it, but whatever it is, it's dragging me to the black door. I'm scrabbling, but I can't get any purchase on the floor, and I slip, and the bed, uh, goes over me. Hurts. I scream until it bashes me in the head.</p>\n<p>I'm completely dazed, and I roll over. See the bed go out the black door. Then I wake up.</p>\n<p><em>And that's when you saw the entity.</em></p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Claire?</em></p>\n<p>Sure.</p>\n<p><em>Hm.</em></p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Is that\u2026 okay?

If you notice anything tag-worthy that's not in here, please mention it in a comment.\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/info:end\">:scp-wiki:info:end</a>]]\n\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-4679-D\n\n\n\n**Object Class:** Decommissioned (formerly Keter; review pending)\n\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The remains of SCP-4679 are kept in a Euclid-class containment cell in Site 135. Examination requires permission from Dr. Sorenson.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-4679 was an entity of unknown origin active in the United Kingdom between 1986 and 2019. As of time of writing, it is an amorphous collection of undifferentiated cells, approximately one tonne in weight. Prior to decommissioning it was incorporeal. It was an oneiric hunter, latching onto one person at a time and consuming them over a period of approximately twenty-four weeks.\n\n\n\nFive stages have been identified as universal to its hunting process. These are as follows:\n\n\n\n* **Stage 1:** SCP-4679 latches onto its victim. Victims report unusually vivid dreams, but no other observable symptoms.\n\n\n\n* **Stage 2:** Moderate to severe pains occur in the victim, as well as headaches and night sweats. Victims report dreams taking place in near total darkness, although the content is otherwise unremarkable.\n\n\n\n* **Stage 3:** In addition to aforementioned symptoms, victims report moderate to severe fatigue, nausea and light-headedness. They also display a low red blood cell count, and as such this is usually the stage at which civilian cases are identified. Dreams now include an entity, believed to be a representation of SCP-4679, which stalks the victim, although they often experience no unease regarding it.\n\n\n\n* **Stage 4:** Fatigue becomes extreme, with victims often unable to leave their beds. Sleep paralysis is common. Activity in the thalamus is greatly reduced at this stage. Dream content is difficult to ascertain at this point, but seems to commonly involve the entity consuming parts of the victim's body, although again, they do not seem perturbed.\n\n\n\n* **Stage 5:** Victims become fully comatose. Brain activity becomes negligible. No victims have recovered from this state. At time of writing, 387 people in Stage 5 are in Foundation care, with more believed to exist unidentified in the general population.\n\n\n\nMuch of the information on earlier stages comes from the 340 Foundation staff members affected by SCP-4679 since its discovery.\n\n\n\nDue to the entity's uncontainable nature, as well as its consistent detrimental impact on Foundation personnel, efforts to decommission it were authorised. See Addenda for further detail.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7:** Junior Researcher Claire Halloway was identified as a Stage 3 victim of SCP-4679, and as such was chosen as the decommissioning vector. Procedure 220-Maxtible was the experimental dream manipulation method designed to decommission SCP-4679; it would introduce elements believed to be inimical to oneiric hunters, based on experiences with other such entities. Halloway was the first subject to undergo this procedure. She was granted extended leave for the duration, and was instructed to remain within Site 135 under observation.\n\n\n\nDr. Valerie Whitaker was chosen to liason between Junior Researcher Halloway and the team carrying out Procedure 220-Maxtible. She was to record Halloway's dreams and report them.\n\n\n\nBelow is a log of the first session, prior to the beginning of the procedure, in which Halloway recounts a typical Stage 3 dream. Her speech is written in standard text. Dr. Whitaker's is in //italics//.\n\n\n\n> //How are you feeling?//\n\n> \n\n> Fine.\n\n> \n\n> //There's no need for small talk. Be honest.//\n\n> \n\n> I am. I feel fine. Well, as fine as I ever do. Everyone says this'll work, and I'll be fine. I trust them.\n\n> \n\n> //That's a brave way to look at it.//\n\n> \n\n> Don't patronise me. Not like I have any control over that, is it?\n\n> \n\n> //I'm really not. Shall we begin, then?//\n\n> \n\n> Okay.\n\n> \n\n> //I've read your notes. Try to connect them a bit. Be as clear as you can.//\n\n> \n\n> Yeah. Okay.\n\n> \n\n> It's dark. No, it's not, it's... it's //mostly// dark. There's moonlight. I think. It's hard to tell.\n\n> \n\n> //Go on.//\n\n> \n\n> I think I'm outside. The floor is pavement. I start walking. Don't know where, just... walking. Away. I can see my shadow in front of me, that's about it. Then it turns into another shadow. Blurry, indistinct. There's something else walking behind me, bigger than me.\n\n> \n\n> //Do you know what it is?//\n\n> \n\n> Honestly, I... don't really care. It feels like it's supposed to be there. Not like a friend, like... like a table you've had for years. I dunno. Anyway, we keep walking, and then I, uh, walk up into the air. Like I'm going up invisible stairs. Keep walking, higher and higher.\n\n> \n\n> When I look up, I can see the moon. It's massive, way bigger than it should be. Kinda cool, actually. I keep walking, up and up, closer and closer. Stretch my arm out, it's so close, and...\n\n> \n\n> //And then?//\n\n> \n\n> And then I wake up in a puddle of sweat. Very elegant, right?\n\n> \n\n> //Alright. Thank you, Claire. Would you say that's a fairly typical dream, of late?//\n\n> \n\n> More or less. Is that... good or bad? Like, going from other cases?\n\n> \n\n> //Hard to say, unfortunately.//\n\n> \n\n> Mm.\n\n> \n\n> //They're just refining the procedure. Should get started before next week.//\n\n> \n\n> Good. Let's get on with it.\n\n> \n\n> //I didn't realise you were so keen.//\n\n> \n\n> I'm keen not to have my brain eaten by a murder monster. They've made it abundantly clear that this is gonna suck, but it's better than the alternative. I mean, this //will// work, right? You're sure?\n\n> \n\n> //As sure as we can be.//\n\n> \n\n> Okay. Okay. Guess I shouldn't doubt you lot, then. Yeah, few weeks of suffering, then back to actual work. No problem.\n\n> \n\n> //That's a good attitude to have.//\n\n> \n\n> Yeah, I refuse to die from this. Got too much to do.\n\n> \n\n> //Attagirl.//\n\n\n\n**Addendum 12:** Log of session between Dr. Whitaker and Junior Researcher Halloway. First reported dream following implementation of Procedure 220-Maxtible.\n\n\n\n> I'm in a forest. I don't recognise it - I can barely //see// it, it's pitch black. I'm in my pyjamas, it's freezing, but it's silent. I don't even remember hearing the trees rustle, but there's no leaves to rustle anyway.\n\n> \n\n> Actually, it's not pitch black. More like dusk, there's just a few hints of sunlight. It's mostly dark, though. I \u2014 hmm.\n\n> \n\n> //What is it?//\n\n> \n\n> The sun. It's \u2014 I'm not scared. Uncomfortable. I don't like the darkness, but it's better than the light.\n\n> \n\n> But it doesn't matter, because there's something there with me. I can't see or hear it, but I know it's there. If I turn around, I'll see it, but... I can't do that. Don't ask why, I don't fucking know, but th \u2014 in that moment, everything screams at me not to.\n\n> \n\n> The bushes and stuff have gotten thicker, out of nowhere, like, but I guess that's dreams for you. They keep snagging on me, and I try to push past them but they're slowing me down, and it's still coming, and-\n\n> \n\n> //Take a breath. You're safe here.//\n\n> \n\n> ...It's just... too much. It's getting closer, I //know// it is, and these fucking branches just won't let me through. And then I trip.\n\n> \n\n> Eyes shut straight away, I can't look at it, but I can feel it touching me, it's warm, and it fucking hurts. My face is screwed up so tight, my hands are covering it, and then it's covering my face too. And... then it starts raining.\n\n> \n\n> All of a sudden, there's this... screaming. And the sun comes through the trees. No \u2014 well, yes, it //is// the sun, but it's too bright, too white. And it's searing hot, I open my eyes out of reflex, but the... //thing// is gone. Still screaming. I put my hand out to catch the rain, and it pools in my hand, and it's not rain. It's metal, silver. No, mercury.\n\n> \n\n> I turn to the left and look in the mirror. I'm crying mercury. It's leaking from my eyes, my nose, my mouth, I'm drowning in it, and I feel myself... crystallise? Yeah, I know how daft it sounds, but I know right there and fucking then how fragile I am, like I'll shatter into a million pieces at the slightest touch. And the mercury is still fucking streaming out of me, it's burning so much, I stagger back, trip over something, and as I'm going I know I'm going to break \u2014\n\n> \n\n> And then I woke up.\n\n> \n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> So, is this just what it's gonna be like now, then?\n\n> \n\n> //I'm afraid so. How do you feel?//\n\n> \n\n> Dreamy.\n\n> \n\n> //Very funny.//\n\n> \n\n> ...tired. Light-headed. Bit nauseous. Pretty much what I expected.\n\n> \n\n> //I'm sorry.//\n\n> \n\n> Hey, at least it's //for// something. Had my share of hangovers, felt worse for no reason. There's a goal to this, right?\n\n> \n\n> //Right.//\n\n\n\n**Addendum 22:**\n\n\n\n> //Hey - whoa, are you alright?//\n\n> \n\n> I - oh -\n\n> \n\n> //Okay, just - try to hold it in, let me grab the bin, there -//\n\n> \n\n> //That's better. Let it all out.//\n\n> \n\n> - ugh. Fuck. There's none in my hair, is there?\n\n> \n\n> //I don't think so.//\n\n> \n\n> Ah, shit.\n\n> \n\n> //Do you want a drink?//\n\n> \n\n> Prosecco or gin?\n\n> \n\n> //It's half eleven in the morning.//\n\n> \n\n> Joking. Please. Some water would be good.\n\n> \n\n> //Here you go.//\n\n> \n\n> //Do you want to talk about it?//\n\n> \n\n> That's what I'm supposed to do, isn't it? Not like I've done anything else for the past - shit, how long is it?\n\n> \n\n> //Four weeks since they started.//\n\n> \n\n> Jesus. That all?\n\n> \n\n> //It's not as long as you'd think.//\n\n> \n\n> Says the woman on the other side of the table.\n\n> \n\n> //Fair enough. When you're ready, then.//\n\n> \n\n> Okay. Yeah. Uh, I'm in a boat. Little wooden one, drifting. The sea's red.\n\n> \n\n> //Blood?//\n\n> \n\n> I don't know. I'm not scared of it. Yeah, um, I'm lying back, and there's a drip in my arm. Like, an IV. Not sure what's in it, but the liquid's silver.\n\n> \n\n> The sun is... beating down. It's baking hot. Suffocating. I feel sluggish, like I can barely move. Barely breathe. The air's all shimmery, everything's all blurry, out of focus, and - and - ohfuck -\n\n> \n\n> //Do you need the bin ag- okay, yes, you do.//\n\n> \n\n> //Are you going to be alright?//\n\n> \n\n> Would it matter if I said no?\n\n> \n\n> //It would to me.//\n\n> \n\n> Ugh. I mean, uh... shit, sorry, I do appreci-\n\n> \n\n> //You have nothing to apologise for.//\n\n> \n\n> Hmph.\n\n> \n\n> There's something at the front of the boat. Indistinct, but I don't know if that's just it or it's because I can't see shit. It's small, curled up. Whimpering. There's a tube from the IV leading to it, too. No needle though, it just looks like it's been rammed in. Blood's all crusted around where it goes in, that's clear at least.\n\n> \n\n> Sorry, just...\n\n> \n\n> //I've got some Nurofen, if you-//\n\n> \n\n> Not allowed it. Fucks with the magic, apparently, God only knows why.\n\n> \n\n> //Hm. Let me email Dr. Afolayan, I'm sure he'll know what you can take.//\n\n> \n\n> Thanks.\n\n> \n\n> //You're doing very well under the circumstances, you know.//\n\n> \n\n> Hmph. I'm gonna be alright, aren't I? Not much point in moaning.\n\n> \n\n> //There's every point in moaning, if you need to.//\n\n> \n\n> Mm.\n\n> \n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> I'll just... carry on, then.\n\n> \n\n> //If you're up to it.//\n\n> \n\n> Yeah. It's, uh, it's weird, I know this thing is... well, I know what this thing is. Still, looking at it there, all small, it's kind of... pitiful? I mean, let's be honest, this thing's killed a fuckload of people, and it's struggling with //me//? Heh, come on.\n\n> \n\n> But I can't look at it anymore. Not like before, I don't feel like something awful will happen if I do, I just... can't. But at the same time I... pull towards it. The drip comes with me, I'd forgotten about it, actually. I find myself reaching towards it. My hand gets so close. And it's scared, actually scared, I can feel it.\n\n> \n\n> //And then?//\n\n> \n\n> And then I wake up feeling like death and stagger to you.\n\n> \n\n> //Ah. I wasn't going to bring up the pyjamas.//\n\n> \n\n> Shut up, my mum likes the Muppets.\n\n> \n\n> //I'm sure. Oh, Alfred's gotten in touch. You can have paracetamol, at least. Head on down there, I think this is enough.//\n\n> \n\n> Alright.\n\n> \n\n> //Maybe get dressed first.//\n\n> \n\n> Thanks...\n\n> \n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> ...Dr. Whitaker?\n\n> \n\n> //Yes?//\n\n> \n\n> I'm going to be alright, aren't I?\n\n> \n\n> //I certainly think it's looking that way.//\n\n> \n\n> Yeah. Fuck. I was kind of enjoying the time off.\n\n> \n\n> //Got to get back to the grind eventually.//\n\n\n\n**Addendum 25:** Early in the morning on 27/10/19, security were called urgently to Junior Researcher Halloway's dormitory. They arrived to find SCP-4679 as described above slowly coagulating in the bed, with the researcher huddled in the corner. The entity was quickly contained, and identified as SCP-4679 using [DATA EXPUNGED].[[footnote]]This technique is not fully understood, but suggested a 68.3% probability of the entity being SCP-4679 based on oneiric signifiers.[[/footnote]] A few hours later, it ceased all signs of life, and was declared decommissioned.\n\n\n\nBelow is the final official session between Dr. Whitaker and Junior Researcher Halloway, taking place eight days after.\n\n\n\n> //Well then. How are you feeling?//\n\n> \n\n> Fine.\n\n> \n\n> //It must be a relief, at least.//\n\n> \n\n> Yeah. Definitely.\n\n> \n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> //So-//\n\n> \n\n> I'm in Site 135. Cleaner than I've ever seen it, all sterile white. Feel like I'm making it dirty just being there. My dorm's to the left of me, but the bed's full of spiders, so I don't go there. Just go down the corridor. There's a few other people there, Dr. Vlaar, Jonas, few others I don't recognise, but they don't see me, just walk past. The hallway's too wide, but I don't really notice Windows are boarded up or something, I can't tell if it's night or day.\n\n> \n\n> I end up in the infirmary. It's pretty much empty, but there's one bed occupied, covered with a sheet. I don't go near it. There's a door on the other side that shouldn't be there, so I go through, but I come out back in the infirmary, the way I came in the first time. Try again a few times, same thing happens. Try to leave the other way, shock horror, I come in through the other door.\n\n> \n\n> Not sure how long that goes on. Way too long. So I sit on one of the beds and start pulling the pillow apart. I can feel the bed behind me, staring at me, but like fuck am I going near there. Until I've been sat there for... I have no idea. Too long. But there's no other way out.\n\n> \n\n> It's, uh, me. Under the sheet, I mean. It's me. Not sure if I - she's alive or, um, y'know, but her eyes are open. Blank. Silver. It's like tear stains down my face, except they're burned in, like I was crying acid. I try to close my - her eyes, but the skin flakes away in my hand, like I'm running my finger across an old fireplace or something. The veins are weird, prominent. I touch one, just to see, and it collapses, cuts through the skin. Take a wild fucking guess what leaks out.\n\n> \n\n> No idea why, but I grab the bed, try to wheel it away. The two doors are gone, just holes in the wall. I can see the red emergency lighting through the one that shouldn't be there. Just black, the other way. I push myself toward the red door.\n\n> \n\n> Something drags me back. I don't sense, uh, it, but whatever it is, it's dragging me to the black door. I'm scrabbling, but I can't get any purchase on the floor, and I slip, and the bed, uh, goes over me. Hurts. I scream until it bashes me in the head.\n\n> \n\n> I'm completely dazed, and I roll over. See the bed go out the black door. Then I wake up.\n\n> \n\n> //And that's when you saw the entity.//\n\n> \n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> //Claire?//\n\n> \n\n> Sure.\n\n> \n\n> //Hm.//\n\n> \n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> Is that... okay? Like, uh, is that an... okay dream?\n\n> \n\n> //Well-//\n\n> \n\n> Yeah, that's a stupid fucking question, sorry. Sorry, yeah, I've got to get back. Farnsworth wants me number crunching.\n\n> \n\n> //Well, okay-//\n\n> \n\n> See you around, Dr. Whitaker.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 27:** The following is a log of an informal session, instigated three weeks after those of Addendum 25 at the behest of Dr. Whitaker.\n\n\n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> Why am I here?\n\n> \n\n> //Do you not want to be?//\n\n> \n\n> No, I just - look, we're done, aren't we? I don't have to go through this, so why am I here?\n\n> \n\n> //Are you alright, Claire?//\n\n> \n\n> The f- what are you talking about?\n\n> \n\n> //...//\n\n> \n\n> Did someone grass on me? Was it Farnsworth?\n\n> \n\n> //Claire...//\n\n> \n\n> I swear, I'm gonna kick him in the bollocks when you let me out of here.\n\n> \n\n> //Claire-//\n\n> \n\n> Does he even have - what's the Foundation trans health plan anyway? No, look, it's none of my business, you know what, I'll just kick him in the crotch and see what happ-\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> //CLAIRE!//\n\n>\n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> //No-one reported you. Although I think Farnsworth// is //worried about you.//\n\n> \n\n> I didn't think he was capable.\n\n> \n\n> //No, I heard you last week. On the phone.//\n\n> \n\n> What are you... oh.\n\n\n\n> **Foreword:** Security feed from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7903 Site 135 sensory room], 22/11/19.\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> //Junior Researcher Halloway enters, and slowly walks to the mattress, letting the door slowly close behind her. She sits motionless for approximately twenty minutes, staring at nothing.//\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> //Hesitantly, she pulls out her phone, before grimacing and dropping it beside her. She does not move for another ten minutes.//\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> //Halloway retrieves her phone, and scrolls through it.

Fuck, I've barely even spoken to her since. Except for drunk-texting, but that doesn't count, that's just me being annoying. I always meant to, I always needed to, I needed to make sure she knew it wasn't her fault, I just... never did. And now... what if I don't get the chance?\n\n> \n\n> //Claire...//\n\n> \n\n> Plus I never finished watching //Voyager//.

I just suggested to Dr. Sorenson we double-check, for peace of mind. He complained, as usual, but I strong-armed him into it eventually. The results came in two hours ago.//\n\n> \n\n> ...and?\n\n> \n\n> //I don't know. I wanted you to be here when I looked. Thought you were owed that much, at least.//\n\n> \n\n> ...I don't want to look.\n\n> \n\n> //I know.//\n\n> \n\n> Can't I just... I'm alright like this. Not //great//, like, but it'll do. This'll do. Can't I just... stay like this?\n\n> \n\n> //Claire, I don't know whether that thing in the containment cell is alive or not. I don't know if it's coming for you. If not, then fantastic. You've lost nothing, you can go about your life. Finish// Voyager, //buy Martha some flowers.//\n\n> \n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> //If it is, you know what? You're still going to do all those things. This works. It might not have completed the job this time around, but it// works. //And yes, it'll be awful. I'm not going to bullshit you, it'll be tedious, and sickening, and painful, and you will hate every bit of it. But it'll work. And you'll get the chance to do everything you want to do.//\n\n> \n\n> I'm not sure I can.\n\n> \n\n> //You don't have to be sure. You just have to know that chance is there. I wish I had something more inspiring to say, but this isn't inspiring. It's a slog, and the only reward is not having to go through more of it. But that's there for you. And, for the record, so am I. All you can do is try and keep up a good outlook, just to keep you going, and yes, I know that's easy for me to say, but I know you can do it. Remember what you said to me, first session we had?//\n\n> \n\n> I said a lot of things.\n\n> \n\n> //Work with me here. I said how good your attitude was, and you said...//\n\n> \n\n> I refuse to die from this.\n\n> \n\n> //There you go.//\n\n> \n\n> ...\n\n> \n\n> I'm so tired.\n\n> \n\n> //I know. I'm so sorry. But you can't rest yet.//\n\n> \n\n> ...fuck.\n\n> \n\n> Fuck it. All the damn monsters in this world, I'm not getting killed by the fucking blob that gives you cheese dreams. That's just be fucking embarrassing.\n\n> \n\n> //Attagirl.//\n\n> \n\n> Look, the cafeteria's gonna be out of custard if we don't get there soon.

He staggered for a sec before standing straight up and looking at me just the same as he did before.\n\n\n\nI asked if he felt that.\n\n\n\n\"Harry, all I feel is //bored//.\"\n\n\n\nI paused for a moment, thinking a bit, and raised it to his cheek, slowly drawing it back to give a shallow cut, and put the knife into my pocket.\n\n\n\nThis managed to get a wince out of him, but even then, with blood leaking down to his jaw, he just looked at me with a hesitant smirk.\n\n\n\nI let him go after making plans to get dinner later. If there's still blood at the end of the day, I'll know for sure just how far it goes.

Folks kept asking about it and Smalls kept saying it was nothing, and everyone seemed to buy it. But... only after looking at me. So they seem to know things I do with the knife, at least.\n\n\n\nI'm probably going to hell for this, but while Smalls wasn't looking I slipped a Class-W mnestic into his drink to check if that had any effect. Ten minutes after he'd finished it I presented the knife and the same basic questions, and he was still clueless as ever.\n\n\n\nOn Class-W mnestics.\n\n\n\nI'm not going to pursue this further, if only for the fact that I can't ask if we've got stronger antimemes, but I'm going to run it through the antimeme machine just to double check.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Log 5 - 2055/01/3\" hide=\"Log 5 - 2055/01/3\"]]\n\nI'm at the end of my damn rope here.\n\n\n\nI decided to give my own cheek a cut to see how folks reacted to it. On the way back, a few people asked, and every time I said I cut my cheek with 4955, and every time they walked away without another word. A few of them covered their mouth with their hands as they walked away for reasons I can't quite place.\n\n\n\nIf that wasn't enough, I ran it through the antimeme machine and it gave nothing.\n\n\n\nZilch.\n\n\n\nIt's not an antimeme that mnestics can touch or that the QNTM machines can detect.\n\n\n\nBut... Why?\n\n\n\nThere's no chance that everyone //can// see it, right? There's no way this isn't an antimeme.

1922.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Archived Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-5281 is held in a standard humanoid containment cell at <a href=\"/secure-facility-dossier-site-43\">Site-43</a> for twenty-three hours of each day. Its activities between 19:00 and 20:00 hours do not present a significant threat to the Veil.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Archived Description:</strong> SCP-5281 is a being resembling an elderly male human, invariably dressed in period attire from late nineteenth-century Canada. Depending on its actions between 19:00 and 20:00 hours each day, it will accumulate extra articles of clothing or shed existing ones. It practices poor personal hygiene, speaks in unaccented French or English, and behaves cordially when spoken to.</p>\n<p>At 7:00 PM EST/EDT every day, SCP-5281 manifests a burlap sack through unknown means and disappears from its chamber. All attempts to arrest this process have failed.</p>\n<p>SCP-5281 is also capable of manifesting, at will, a small burlap pouch filled with silicon dioxide. This substance is capable of inducing sleep in subjects between the ages of five and ten years of age.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5281-1, Containment History:</strong> Precursor entities to the SCP Foundation and other longstanding normalcy-stabilizing organizations encountered SCP-5281 sporadically between 1919 and 1992, when it was finally apprehended. Its existence is attested in French-Canadian folklore as early as 1890.</p>\n<p>On 6 November 1992, Qu\u00e9bec City police discovered an apparent vagrant living in Montmorency Park. When background checks on this vagrant failed, and his peculiar responses to their inquiries raised further suspicion, the investigating officers contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. When the vagrant disappeared at 7:00 PM during interrogation and reappeared one hour later, the RCMP's Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce forwarded the case to the SCP Foundation.<span class=\"fnnum\">.</span><span class=\"fncon\">OSAT lacked the capacity to effectively detain anomalous humanoids indefinitely.</span></p>\n<p>On 9 November 1992 the vagrant was classified SCP-5281 and transferred to Site-43. Its initial containment interview is excerpted below.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 10 November 1992</p>\n<p><strong>Investigating Agent:</strong> Specialist N. Zaman (Psychology and Parapsychology Section)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Could you state your name, for the record?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> <em>Bonhomme Sept-Heures.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Uh\u2026 alright. What does that mean?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> You don't speak French?</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 clucks its tongue chidingly.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> It means \"the seven o'clock man.\" There's a positive connotation to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Right, \"<em>bon</em>\" means \"good.\"</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> You DO speak French!</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Just the very basics.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Well, at any rate, the French like to call their mythological men \"<em>bonhomme.</em>\" They think if they're properly respectful, they'll be protected.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Does it work?</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 chuckles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> So, where do you go at seven o'clock each night?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Oh, many places. I have to move quickly, you know, Qu\u00e9bec is such a big place these days.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> You're saying you go back to Qu\u00e9bec?</p>\n<p><em>Specialist Zaman consults his notes.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> It says here you were wearing three overcoats when OSAT brought you in. You're only wearing a light cape now. Why is that?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> I'm feeling warmer.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Alright, but why is <em>that?</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Because I've eaten recently.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Oh, so you go out hunting?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> In a manner of speaking.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> What do you hunt?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Children.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> I beg your pardon?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> For what?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> You're telling me you\u2026 eat children?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Well, you did ask.</p>\n</div>\n<p>SCP-5281 clarified that it only consumed children who had been instructed to sleep, or to return to their homes, before 7:00 PM each night. It prevented their escape by sprinkling anomalously-manifested sand in their eyes, somehow inducing a comatose state.</p>\n<p>The following day, Site-43 received the following letter from the Chief Superintendent of OSAT.</p>\n<div style=\"border:solid 2px #FF0000; background:#FFFFB4; padding-left:12px; padding-right:12px; padding-top:6px; margin-bottom: 10px;\">\n<h4 id=\"toc0\"><span>ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE</span></h4>\n<h4 id=\"toc1\"><span>OCCULT AND SUPERNATURAL ACTIVITY TASKFORCE</span></h4>\n\n<p>Police in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec have been reporting the periodic abduction and subsequent murder of children by persons unknown since the turn of the century. These children are found partially eaten, the bite marks on their flesh and bone consistent with human teeth.</p>\n<p>No connection with the anomalous subject recently released to your custody was made until approximately seven o'clock last night, when said subject was spotted by an eyewitness in Ville-Marie, Montr\u00e9al shortly before a new occurrence of this phenomenon. As presumably you are not in the habit of catching and releasing anomalous subjects, we expect an explanation at your earliest convenience.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><em>\u2014 Sergeant Benoit Gauthier, Chief Superintendent, OSAT</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>OSAT was informed that they had only succeeded in capturing a single member of a larger collective of anomalous filial cannibals. They resultantly stepped up their surveillance of residential neighbourhoods in the province of Qu\u00e9bec.</p>\n<p>While attempts were made to prevent SCP-5281 from escaping its chamber, including prototype reality anchors, special structural alloys and thaumaturgy, Specialist Zaman was instructed to continue interrogating SCP-5281. Selected excerpts from their interviews follow.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 12-15 November 1992</p>\n<p><strong>Investigating Agent:</strong> Specialist N. Zaman (Psychology and Parapsychology)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> So, why is it that you eat\u2026 children.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 shrugs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> I don't want to eat anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Well, have you tried? We can get you any kind of food you like.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Oh, I don't eat food.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Beg pardon?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> I don't get hungry. I've never <em>been</em> hungry. I've had the sensation described to me, so I understand what you mean when you say it, but it's as foreign to me as I am to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Then why\u2026 why do you\u2026?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Because it's what I want to do.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 points at Specialist Zaman's bottle of water.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Why do you drink that?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Because I need water to survive.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Oh. Well, that's not helpful then.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> You don't need to eat children to survive?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> No, of course not. Children have very few nutrients in them. More than babies, to be sure, but still. Most of them are all skin and bone!</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> You don't eat every day.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> And you get cold when you don't eat? Hence the extra clothing?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Oh, it's not that dramatic. I get <em>colder,</em> I suppose, but it's never truly uncomfortable. I just like to keep a rosy glow in my cheeks.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 smiles.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> How long have you gone without\u2026 feeding?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Oh, I once went as long as a month, just to see if I could.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> What effect did that have?</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 shrugs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> I didn't really notice any effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> So it doesn't even make you uncomfortable when you don't eat?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Not really.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Then why do you keep doing it?</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 appears confused.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Because I want to?</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> You do realize that children are people. Sapient human beings.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Of course. You know, I <em>do</em> put them to sleep before I eat them. I'm sure I mentioned that.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> How considerate of you. But you do also realize that they have parents, who love them. Who will miss them when they're gone.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Yes, of course.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> And yet\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Go on?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> And yet you still eat them?</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 sighs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> We get along well, you and I, but your fixation on this one element of my personality is really beginning to grate on me.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> What I'm\u2026 what I'm <em>saying</em> is, you don't need to do this.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> But I enjoy it.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> But you don't <em>need</em> to do it! You could just stop!</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> I don't want to stop.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> I don't even understand your motivations here. It doesn't make sense.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> It doesn't make sense to me that you die of old age, or need to drink water, or need to bathe. These things don't make <em>any</em> sense to me. I know what I am, Noor, and I act accordingly. Do you know who you are?</p>\n</div>\n<p>After the conclusion of this final interview Specialist Zaman presented the following proposal to Dr. V.L. Scout, Director of Site-43.</p>\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\">\n<p>Sir,</p>\n<p>I propose the immediate subjection of SCP-5281 to decommissioning procedures. There can be no moral excuse for retaining it, given its proclivities, and I do not foresee any negative consequences to its elimination.</p>\n<p>This matter is time-sensitive; each day that passes carries the potential for increasing the number of its victims.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p><em>\u2014 Noor Zaman, Psychology and Parapsychology</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Dr. Scout immediately forwarded this information, and Specialist Zaman's notes, to the Ethics Committee. Three days later the Committee sent a representative to discuss the matter in greater detail.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Meeting Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 18 November 1992</p>\n<p><strong>Present:</strong> Dr. J.

Very pleasant to talk to, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> We've noticed.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> I'll have to go over the file again, but as of this moment I can't think of anything the Ethics Committee would take issue with.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> I beg your pardon?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> He <em>eats children.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> Yes, well, don't put any children in there with him. You weren't going to, were you?</p>\n<p><em>Specialist Zaman shakes his head.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> He leaves his chamber. To eat children.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Cimmerian attempts to reply unsuccessfully for several seconds.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> You let him out of his\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> HE TELEPORTS OUT OF HIS CHAMBER\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Specialist Zaman takes a deep breath.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> He teleports out of his chamber, to Qu\u00e9bec, and he hunts down children, and he eats them.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> You need to clarify the description in the file. That's, that's\u2026 okay. Well that's abhorrent, but\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> But?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> But I don't think the Ethics Committee\u2026 okay. How often does he do this?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> About once a month.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> So, twelve children per year?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> I suppose?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> Do you know what the birth rate in Qu\u00e9bec is, offhand? We need to figure out percentages here.</p>\n<p><em>Specialist Zaman struggles to answer. Dr. Cimmerian raises a hand to interrupt him.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> Overwatch is going to ask me these questions, you understand? And if they don't think the risk of disrupting normalcy is too high, they're going to refuse your decommissioning request. If you can't make a strong enough case, I won't even pass it along; I have to pick my battles carefully, they barely take us seriously as it is.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> You've got to be kidding.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> If I was going to kid you, I'd pick a funnier topic than child cannibalism.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> There must be something we can do.</p>\n<p><em>Dr. Cimmerian shrugs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> You could try asking him to eat less.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Specialist Zaman subsequently proposed a new activity to SCP-5281: stalking its targets, but not consuming them. SCP-5281 agreed to attempt this approach for a brief period, and unexplained child fatalities in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec dropped off sharply. On 18 January 1993, however, police discovered the mutilated body of an eight-year-old boy in Laval, Qu\u00e9bec. Specialist Zaman interviewed SCP-5281 to determine its involvement.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 18 January 1993</p>\n<p><strong>Investigating Agent:</strong> Specialist N.

Do you have a photograph?</p>\n<p><em>Specialist Zaman slides two photographs across the table. SCP-5281 examines them both, then taps one with his fingers.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> This one's messy. You could've just given me the headshot.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> I wanted to remind you of what you did.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 regards Specialist Zaman carefully.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> You seem different today, Noor. Colder.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Or is that cold rage?</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording. SCP-5281 snaps its fingers suddenly.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> I know that look. I once saw it on a man's face when he discovered what I'd done. I watched him through the window of his daughter's bedroom. I wanted to see\u2026 well. All that talk about how I was making the parents of these children feel, I wanted to see it. You were right, he was very upset. Just like you are now.</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Congratulations are obviously in order! Is it a boy, or a girl?</p>\n<p><em>Specialist Zaman deactivates the recording device.</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Specialist Zaman was relieved of his interview duties after brutally assaulting SCP-5281. He requested permanent reassignment to a different dossier, citing \"a layered conflict of interest\"; as no other personnel were sufficiently familiar with SCP-5281, this request was denied.</p>\n<p>On 12 March 1994, a convoy carrying sensitive Foundation documents from Site-43 to Site-19 was waylaid by parties unknown and its contents stolen. The following day, a letter from the Undersecretary-General of the Global Occult Coalition was delivered to Site-43.</p>\n<div style=\"color: black; border: solid 2px #275495; background:#fff url('https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Agoc/goc-fade.png') center no-repeat; padding:15px; margin: 10px auto; width: 80%\">\n<p>Director Scout,</p>\n<p>I hope this letter finds you well. We have not had cause to communicate before, and should we have cause again in the future, I hope the circumstances will be more pleasant.</p>\n<p>We are aligned in our pursuit of the greater good. On that basis, we have turned a blind eye to some of your more unsavoury practices, even those which directly contravene the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>\n<p>In relation to the SCP object designated 5281, however, we must strenuously differ. Don't ask why. You <em>know</em> why.</p>\n<p>What possible harm to the greater good could the destruction of this object effect? Destroy it, and soon, or there will be repercussions.</p>\n<p>A copy of this letter has been forwarded to the O5 Council.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<p><em>\u2014 D.C. al Fine, Undersecretary-General, Global Occult Coalition</em></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The O5 Council informed the Undersecretary-General that the Foundation had already decommissioned SCP-5281, and that it had subsequently remanifested outside of containment. This cover was relayed to Dr. Scout, for purposes of consistent messaging. Director Scout inquired as to whether the GOC had been responsible for waylaying the convoy; he was instructed not to press the issue further.</p>\n<p>Specialist Zaman continued to interview SCP-5281 sporadically, though he successfully requested a transfer to the Hiring and Regulation Section in 1994. He issued frequent complaints about the continuance of his interview duties, which he considered unduly onerous. He also frequently requested that SCP-5281 be considered for decommissioning, resulting in the meeting excerpted below.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Meeting Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 5 February 1995</p>\n<p><strong>Present:</strong> Dir.

He's terrible.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> Friendly, likable even, but extremely\u2026 terrible.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> The fact that he leaves his chamber at will, and what he does while he's out there\u2026</p>\n<p><em>Director Bold pauses for a moment.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> To move forward, which we absolutely should be doing, I just need one question answered.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Shoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> Do you know what he is?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Pardon?</p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> Do you know what he is?

What he's made of, what his origin is?</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> No.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> Is he a mythological figure? A god? An atemporal creature, existing in all timelines, or at all times at once?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> Is he a thoughtform? An element of the public imaginary, interwoven into French Canadian society?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> Is he\u2014</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> I DON'T KNOW!</p>\n<p><em>Specialist Zaman stands up, and paces around the room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> I don't know.</p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> So if we were to attempt his decommissioning, can you say it wouldn't drive everyone in Qu\u00e9bec insane, or change the past, or create a multiversal paradox? Please understand me here: I want to help you get rid of this thing. I don't like uncontrolled variables, and I <em>really</em> don't like <em>murderous</em> uncontrolled variables. Can you tell me anything about what he <em>is,</em> deep down inside, that would help me make the case that we're safer, better off, with him gone?</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> <em>[Quietly]</em> He eats children.</p>\n<p><em>Director Bold stands up.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Director Bold:</strong> Please don't drop this, I'm on your side.

Thank you, sir.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Specialist Zaman pressed the issue with SCP-5281 for several weeks without success. SCP-5281 finally agreed to be more forthcoming if Specialist Zaman joined it for periodic recreation activities; despite strenuous objections, Specialist Zaman was instructed to accede to this request. The following interview was the eventual result.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 12 June 1995</p>\n<p><strong>Investigating Agent:</strong> Specialist N.

I wasn't really there at the time.</p>\n<p><em>Specialist Zaman sighs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> We're trying to figure out if you're actually a human being, or if you're something more\u2026 complex.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> Like what?</p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> Like\u2026 I don't know. Like a myth, or something dreamed into existence by the French Canadian collective unconscious.</p>\n<p><em>SCP-5281 bursts into laughter.</em></p>\n<p><strong>SCP-5281:</strong> That's really too much.</p>\n<p><em>Specialist Zaman frowns.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> We've found things like that, you know.

Retaliatory attacks on the Site's data servers by the Church of Maxwellism ensued, with unclear results.</p>\n<p>The following day, Director Scout received a pair of letters from OSAT and the GOC demanding to know why they had been misinformed as to the status of SCP-5281. With O5 approval, Director Scout agreed to meet with Sergeant Gauthier and D.C. al Fine at Site-43. Director Bold, Dr. Cimmerian and Specialist Zaman were also invited to attend.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Meeting Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 8 January 1996</p>\n<p><strong>Present:</strong> Undersecretary-General D.C. al Fine (Global Occult Coalition), Dr. J. Cimmerian (Ethics Committee), Dir. C. Bold (Decommissioning Department), Sergeant B. Gauthier (OSAT), Dr. V.L. Scout, Specialist N. Zaman (Hiring and Regulation)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> Thank you all for coming.</p>\n<p><strong>Sergeant Gauthier:</strong> As if you wanted this.</p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Bold:</strong> Maybe we did. That depends on you.</p>\n<p><strong>Sergeant Gauthier:</strong> What's that supposed to mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Bold:</strong> Give me a good reason, a <em>very good</em> reason, to decommission this object, and I will pursue it as a matter of Directorial prerogative.</p>\n<p><strong>Undersecretary-General al Fine:</strong> There is zero proof that this anomaly was causing serious concealment problems out in the wild. All it did was confuse a few cops, and scare a few passers-by in the park. Containing it isn't helping to maintain your Veil, is my point. All you're doing is keeping it comfortable while it goes around eating children.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> Therefore?</p>\n<p><strong>Undersecretary-General al Fine:</strong> Therefore, you're not advancing the GOC's goals by keeping this thing alive. We believe that any anomaly which can be safely and secretly destroyed, <em>should</em> be destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> Well, you don't make an issue about anything else we've got locked up here.</p>\n<p><strong>Undersecretary-General al Fine:</strong> Nothing else you have locked up here eats children. Our mission statement doesn't specifically state our opposition to things which do that, but it's pretty strongly implied.</p>\n<p><strong>Sergeant Gauthier:</strong> And you don't even <em>have</em> it locked up! Not really. OSAT has stayed out of your way for decades, Scout, but this thing is killing kids in Qu\u00e9bec. Regularly. We're tired of cleaning up your mess, and I'm strongly considering\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> What?</p>\n<p><strong>Sergeant Gauthier:</strong> I think I need to have a talk with the Prime Minister about how much cooperation we want to extend to you, in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> Hm.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> Has anyone asked 5281 if he even cares what happens to him?</p>\n<p><em>Silence on recording.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Specialist Zaman:</strong> It's never come up. I've never broached the topic of his decommissioning before.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Cimmerian:</strong> Well, to be frank, at this point the ethics math is pretty clear. He's got to have a body count in the hundreds by now, and if he doesn't care whether he lives or dies, I don't see any Committee objection to putting him down.</p>\n<p><strong>Dir. Bold:</strong> From what I've seen from your interviews, Specialist, <em>he</em> certainly doesn't think he's an inextricable cultural element. And considering the effects of your\u2026 outburst, in 1993, he would appear to be as fragile as any human being. His Decommissioning might be a very simple affair, logistically, and the benefits are extremely obvious. I really don't see any downsides, to be honest.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Scout:</strong> It's good to have you both on board, but that won't be enough to convince O5 to destroy an object that still has little to no effect on the Veil.</p>\n<p><strong>Undersecretary-General al Fine:</strong> You know what might?</p>\n<p><strong>Sergeant Gauthier:</strong> I move we retire to our respective offices, and start drafting letters.</p>\n</div>\n<p>On the receipt of ultimatums from the Global Occult Coalition and OSAT, threatening punitive action against and reduced cooperation with the SCP Foundation, the O5 Council instructed Dir.

Its activities between 19:00 and 20:00 hours do not present a significant threat to the Veil.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Archived Description:** SCP-5281 is a being resembling an elderly male human, invariably dressed in period attire from late nineteenth-century Canada. Depending on its actions between 19:00 and 20:00 hours each day, it will accumulate extra articles of clothing or shed existing ones. It practices poor personal hygiene, speaks in unaccented French or English, and behaves cordially when spoken to.\n\n\n\nAt 7:00 PM EST/EDT every day, SCP-5281 manifests a burlap sack through unknown means and disappears from its chamber. All attempts to arrest this process have failed.\n\n\n\nSCP-5281 is also capable of manifesting, at will, a small burlap pouch filled with silicon dioxide. This substance is capable of inducing sleep in subjects between the ages of five and ten years of age.\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[div]]\n\n**Addendum 5281-1, Containment History:** Precursor entities to the SCP Foundation and other longstanding normalcy-stabilizing organizations encountered SCP-5281 sporadically between 1919 and 1992, when it was finally apprehended. Its existence is attested in French-Canadian folklore as early as 1890.\n\n\n\nOn 6 November 1992, Qu\u00e9bec City police discovered an apparent vagrant living in Montmorency Park. When background checks on this vagrant failed, and his peculiar responses to their inquiries raised further suspicion, the investigating officers contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. When the vagrant disappeared at 7:00 PM during interrogation and reappeared one hour later, the RCMP's Occult and Supernatural Activity Taskforce forwarded the case to the SCP Foundation.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]OSAT lacked the capacity to effectively detain anomalous humanoids indefinitely.[[/span]]\n\n\n\nOn 9 November 1992 the vagrant was classified SCP-5281 and transferred to Site-43. Its initial containment interview is excerpted below.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interview Log**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 10 November 1992\n\n\n\n**Investigating Agent:** Specialist N. Zaman (Psychology and Parapsychology Section)\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Could you state your name, for the record?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** //Bonhomme Sept-Heures.//\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Uh... alright. What does that mean?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** You don't speak French?\n\n\n\n//SCP-5281 clucks its tongue chidingly.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** It means \"the seven o'clock man.\" There's a positive connotation to it.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Right, \"//bon//\" means \"good.\"\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** You DO speak French!\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Just the very basics. \n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Well, at any rate, the French like to call their mythological men \"//bonhomme.//\" They think if they're properly respectful, they'll be protected.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Does it work?\n\n\n\n//SCP-5281 chuckles.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** No.\n\n\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** So, where do you go at seven o'clock each night?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Oh, many places. I have to move quickly, you know, Qu\u00e9bec is such a big place these days.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** You're saying you go back to Qu\u00e9bec?\n\n\n\n//Specialist Zaman consults his notes.//\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** It says here you were wearing three overcoats when OSAT brought you in. You're only wearing a light cape now. Why is that?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** I'm feeling warmer.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Alright, but why is //that?//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Because I've eaten recently.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Oh, so you go out hunting?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** In a manner of speaking.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** What do you hunt?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Children.\n\n\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** I beg your pardon?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** For what?\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** You're telling me you... eat children?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Well, you did ask.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nSCP-5281 clarified that it only consumed children who had been instructed to sleep, or to return to their homes, before 7:00 PM each night. It prevented their escape by sprinkling anomalously-manifested sand in their eyes, somehow inducing a comatose state.\n\n\n\nThe following day, Site-43 received the following letter from the Chief Superintendent of OSAT.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #FF0000; background:#FFFFB4; padding-left:12px; padding-right:12px; padding-top:6px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n++++ ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\n\n++++ OCCULT AND SUPERNATURAL ACTIVITY TASKFORCE \n\n\n\n[[f>image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/blank-art/OSAT.png]]Police in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec have been reporting the periodic abduction and subsequent murder of children by persons unknown since the turn of the century. These children are found partially eaten, the bite marks on their flesh and bone consistent with human teeth.\n\n\n\nNo connection with the anomalous subject recently released to your custody was made until approximately seven o'clock last night, when said subject was spotted by an eyewitness in Ville-Marie, Montr\u00e9al shortly before a new occurrence of this phenomenon. As presumably you are not in the habit of catching and releasing anomalous subjects, we expect an explanation at your earliest convenience.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n//-- Sergeant Benoit Gauthier, Chief Superintendent, OSAT//\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nOSAT was informed that they had only succeeded in capturing a single member of a larger collective of anomalous filial cannibals. They resultantly stepped up their surveillance of residential neighbourhoods in the province of Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n\n\nWhile attempts were made to prevent SCP-5281 from escaping its chamber, including prototype reality anchors, special structural alloys and thaumaturgy, Specialist Zaman was instructed to continue interrogating SCP-5281. Selected excerpts from their interviews follow.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interview Log**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 12-15 November 1992\n\n\n\n**Investigating Agent:** Specialist N. Zaman (Psychology and Parapsychology)\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** So, why is it that you eat... children.\n\n\n\n//SCP-5281 shrugs.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** I don't want to eat anything else.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Well, have you tried? We can get you any kind of food you like.\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Oh, I don't eat food.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Beg pardon?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** I don't get hungry. I've never //been// hungry. I've had the sensation described to me, so I understand what you mean when you say it, but it's as foreign to me as I am to you.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Then why... why do you...?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Because it's what I want to do.\n\n\n\n//SCP-5281 points at Specialist Zaman's bottle of water.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Why do you drink that?\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Because I need water to survive.\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Oh. Well, that's not helpful then.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** You don't need to eat children to survive?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** No, of course not. Children have very few nutrients in them. More than babies, to be sure, but still. Most of them are all skin and bone!\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** You don't eat every day.\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** No.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** And you get cold when you don't eat? Hence the extra clothing?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Oh, it's not that dramatic. I get //colder,// I suppose, but it's never truly uncomfortable. I just like to keep a rosy glow in my cheeks.\n\n\n\n//SCP-5281 smiles.//\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** How long have you gone without... feeding?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Oh, I once went as long as a month, just to see if I could.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** What effect did that have?\n\n\n\n//SCP-5281 shrugs.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** I didn't really notice any effect.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** So it doesn't even make you uncomfortable when you don't eat?\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Not really.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Then why do you keep doing it?\n\n\n\n//SCP-5281 appears confused.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Because I want to?\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** You do realize that children are people. Sapient human beings.\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Of course. You know, I //do// put them to sleep before I eat them. I'm sure I mentioned that.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** How considerate of you. But you do also realize that they have parents, who love them. Who will miss them when they're gone.\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Yes, of course.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** And yet...\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Go on?\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** And yet you still eat them?\n\n\n\n//SCP-5281 sighs.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** We get along well, you and I, but your fixation on this one element of my personality is really beginning to grate on me.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** What I'm... what I'm //saying// is, you don't need to do this.\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** But I enjoy it.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** But you don't //need// to do it! You could just stop!\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** I don't want to stop.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** I don't even understand your motivations here. It doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** It doesn't make sense to me that you die of old age, or need to drink water, or need to bathe. These things don't make //any// sense to me. I know what I am, Noor, and I act accordingly. Do you know who you are?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAfter the conclusion of this final interview Specialist Zaman presented the following proposal to Dr. V.L. Scout, Director of Site-43.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\"]]\n\nSir,\n\n\n\nI propose the immediate subjection of SCP-5281 to decommissioning procedures. There can be no moral excuse for retaining it, given its proclivities, and I do not foresee any negative consequences to its elimination.\n\n\n\nThis matter is time-sensitive; each day that passes carries the potential for increasing the number of its victims.\n\n\n\n[[>]]\n\n//-- Noor Zaman, Psychology and Parapsychology//\n\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nDr. Scout immediately forwarded this information, and Specialist Zaman's notes, to the Ethics Committee. Three days later the Committee sent a representative to discuss the matter in greater detail.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Meeting Log**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 18 November 1992\n\n\n\n**Present:** Dr. J. Cimmerian (Ethics Committee), Specialist N. Zaman (Psychology and Parapsychology)\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** I must say you run a very humane Site.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** Yes, well, we try.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** He seems perfectly comfortable. Very pleasant to talk to, as well.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** We've noticed.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** I'll have to go over the file again, but as of this moment I can't think of anything the Ethics Committee would take issue with.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** I beg your pardon?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** What?\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** He //eats children.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** Yes, well, don't put any children in there with him. You weren't going to, were you?\n\n\n\n//Specialist Zaman shakes his head.//\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** He leaves his chamber. To eat children.\n\n\n\n//Dr. Cimmerian attempts to reply unsuccessfully for several seconds.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** You let him out of his--\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** HE TELEPORTS OUT OF HIS CHAMBER...\n\n\n\n//Specialist Zaman takes a deep breath.//\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** He teleports out of his chamber, to Qu\u00e9bec, and he hunts down children, and he eats them.\n\n\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** You need to clarify the description in the file. That's, that's... okay. Well that's abhorrent, but...\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** But?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** But I don't think the Ethics Committee... okay. How often does he do this?\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** About once a month.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** So, twelve children per year?\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** I suppose?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** Do you know what the birth rate in Qu\u00e9bec is, offhand? We need to figure out percentages here.\n\n\n\n//Specialist Zaman struggles to answer. Dr. Cimmerian raises a hand to interrupt him.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** Overwatch is going to ask me these questions, you understand? And if they don't think the risk of disrupting normalcy is too high, they're going to refuse your decommissioning request. If you can't make a strong enough case, I won't even pass it along; I have to pick my battles carefully, they barely take us seriously as it is.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** You've got to be kidding.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** If I was going to kid you, I'd pick a funnier topic than child cannibalism.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** There must be something we can do.\n\n\n\n//Dr. Cimmerian shrugs.//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** You could try asking him to eat less.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nSpecialist Zaman subsequently proposed a new activity to SCP-5281: stalking its targets, but not consuming them. SCP-5281 agreed to attempt this approach for a brief period, and unexplained child fatalities in the Province of Qu\u00e9bec dropped off sharply. On 18 January 1993, however, police discovered the mutilated body of an eight-year-old boy in Laval, Qu\u00e9bec. Specialist Zaman interviewed SCP-5281 to determine its involvement.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interview Log**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 18 January 1993\n\n\n\n**Investigating Agent:** Specialist N.

Do you have a photograph?\n\n\n\n//Specialist Zaman slides two photographs across the table. SCP-5281 examines them both, then taps one with his fingers.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** This one's messy. You could've just given me the headshot.\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** I wanted to remind you of what you did.\n\n\n\n//SCP-5281 regards Specialist Zaman carefully.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** You seem different today, Noor.

I once saw it on a man's face when he discovered what I'd done. I watched him through the window of his daughter's bedroom. I wanted to see... well. All that talk about how I was making the parents of these children feel, I wanted to see it. You were right, he was very upset. Just like you are now.\n\n\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n\n\n**SCP-5281:** Congratulations are obviously in order! Is it a boy, or a girl?\n\n\n\n//Specialist Zaman deactivates the recording device.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nSpecialist Zaman was relieved of his interview duties after brutally assaulting SCP-5281. He requested permanent reassignment to a different dossier, citing \"a layered conflict of interest\"; as no other personnel were sufficiently familiar with SCP-5281, this request was denied.\n\n\n\nOn 12 March 1994, a convoy carrying sensitive Foundation documents from Site-43 to Site-19 was waylaid by parties unknown and its contents stolen. The following day, a letter from the Undersecretary-General of the Global Occult Coalition was delivered to Site-43.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 2px #275495; background:#fff url('https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Agoc/goc-fade.png') center no-repeat; padding:15px; margin: 10px auto; width: 80%\"]]\n\nDirector Scout,\n\n\n\nI hope this letter finds you well. We have not had cause to communicate before, and should we have cause again in the future, I hope the circumstances will be more pleasant.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe are aligned in our pursuit of the greater good. On that basis, we have turned a blind eye to some of your more unsavoury practices, even those which directly contravene the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n\n\nIn relation to the SCP object designated 5281, however, we must strenuously differ. Don't ask why. You //know// why.\n\n\n\nWhat possible harm to the greater good could the destruction of this object effect? Destroy it, and soon, or there will be repercussions.\n\n\n\nA copy of this letter has been forwarded to the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n[[<]]\n\n//-- D.C. al Fine, Undersecretary-General, Global Occult Coalition//\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nThe O5 Council informed the Undersecretary-General that the Foundation had already decommissioned SCP-5281, and that it had subsequently remanifested outside of containment. This cover was relayed to Dr. Scout, for purposes of consistent messaging. Director Scout inquired as to whether the GOC had been responsible for waylaying the convoy; he was instructed not to press the issue further.\n\n\n\nSpecialist Zaman continued to interview SCP-5281 sporadically, though he successfully requested a transfer to the Hiring and Regulation Section in 1994. He issued frequent complaints about the continuance of his interview duties, which he considered unduly onerous. He also frequently requested that SCP-5281 be considered for decommissioning, resulting in the meeting excerpted below.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Meeting Log**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 5 February 1995\n\n\n\n**Present:** Dir.

An atemporal creature, existing in all timelines, or at all times at once?\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** I don't know.\n\n\n\n**Director Bold:** Is he a thoughtform? An element of the public imaginary, interwoven into French Canadian society?\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** I don't know.\n\n\n\n**Director Bold:** Is he--\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** I DON'T KNOW!\n\n\n\n//Specialist Zaman stands up, and paces around the room.//\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** I don't know.\n\n\n\n**Director Bold:** So if we were to attempt his decommissioning, can you say it wouldn't drive everyone in Qu\u00e9bec insane, or change the past, or create a multiversal paradox? Please understand me here: I want to help you get rid of this thing. I don't like uncontrolled variables, and I //really// don't like //murderous// uncontrolled variables.

SCP-5281 finally agreed to be more forthcoming if Specialist Zaman joined it for periodic recreation activities; despite strenuous objections, Specialist Zaman was instructed to accede to this request. The following interview was the eventual result.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interview Log**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 12 June 1995\n\n\n\n**Investigating Agent:** Specialist N.

Retaliatory attacks on the Site's data servers by the Church of Maxwellism ensued, with unclear results. \n\n\n\nThe following day, Director Scout received a pair of letters from OSAT and the GOC demanding to know why they had been misinformed as to the status of SCP-5281. With O5 approval, Director Scout agreed to meet with Sergeant Gauthier and D.C. al Fine at Site-43. Director Bold, Dr. Cimmerian and Specialist Zaman were also invited to attend.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Meeting Log**\n\n\n\n**Date:** 8 January 1996\n\n\n\n**Present:** Undersecretary-General D.C. al Fine (Global Occult Coalition), Dr. J. Cimmerian (Ethics Committee), Dir. C. Bold (Decommissioning Department),\u00a0\u00a0Sergeant B. Gauthier (OSAT), Dr. V.L. Scout, Specialist N. Zaman (Hiring and Regulation) \n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Thank you all for coming.\n\n\n\n**Sergeant Gauthier:** As if you wanted this.\n\n\n\n**Dir. Bold:** Maybe we did. That depends on you.\n\n\n\n**Sergeant Gauthier:** What's that supposed to mean?\n\n\n\n**Dir. Bold:** Give me a good reason, a //very good// reason, to decommission this object, and I will pursue it as a matter of Directorial prerogative.\n\n\n\n**Undersecretary-General al Fine:** There is zero proof that this anomaly was causing serious concealment problems out in the wild. All it did was confuse a few cops, and scare a few passers-by in the park. Containing it isn't helping to maintain your Veil, is my point. All you're doing is keeping it comfortable while it goes around eating children.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Therefore?\n\n\n\n**Undersecretary-General al Fine:** Therefore, you're not advancing the GOC's goals by keeping this thing alive. We believe that any anomaly which can be safely and secretly destroyed, //should// be destroyed.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Well, you don't make an issue about anything else we've got locked up here.\n\n\n\n**Undersecretary-General al Fine:** Nothing else you have locked up here eats children. Our mission statement doesn't specifically state our opposition to things which do that, but it's pretty strongly implied.\n\n\n\n**Sergeant Gauthier:** And you don't even //have// it locked up! Not really. OSAT has stayed out of your way for decades, Scout, but this thing is killing kids in Qu\u00e9bec. Regularly. We're tired of cleaning up your mess, and I'm strongly considering...\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** What?\n\n\n\n**Sergeant Gauthier:** I think I need to have a talk with the Prime Minister about how much cooperation we want to extend to you, in the future.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Hm.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** Has anyone asked 5281 if he even cares what happens to him?\n\n\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n\n\n**Specialist Zaman:** It's never come up. I've never broached the topic of his decommissioning before.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Cimmerian:** Well, to be frank, at this point the ethics math is pretty clear. He's got to have a body count in the hundreds by now, and if he doesn't care whether he lives or dies, I don't see any Committee objection to putting him down.\n\n\n\n**Dir. Bold:** From what I've seen from your interviews, Specialist, //he// certainly doesn't think he's an inextricable cultural element. And considering the effects of your... outburst, in 1993, he would appear to be as fragile as any human being. His Decommissioning might be a very simple affair, logistically, and the benefits are extremely obvious. I really don't see any downsides, to be honest.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Scout:** It's good to have you both on board, but that won't be enough to convince O5 to destroy an object that still has little to no effect on the Veil.\n\n\n\n**Undersecretary-General al Fine:** You know what might?\n\n\n\n**Sergeant Gauthier:** I move we retire to our respective offices, and start drafting letters.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nOn the receipt of ultimatums from the Global Occult Coalition and OSAT, threatening punitive action against and reduced cooperation with the SCP Foundation, the O5 Council instructed Dir.

Access to it is strictly forbidden except by unanimous approval of the O5 Council.</p>\n<p><strong>Description (Archived):</strong> SCP-5363 is a sheaf of papers, stapled together in the top-left corner. The top sheet is a cover sheet that reads \"Special Termination Procedures.\"</p>\n<p>Behind the cover sheet, SCP-5363 is organized in sets of two pages. The first page in each set displays the name of a high-ranking, living member of Foundation personnel. The page behind it displays details on how the aforementioned individual will be killed. Whenever the cover sheet is lifted, SCP-5363 will generate a new section behind the existing ones. Currently, SCP-5363 has 22 pages, excluding the cover sheet.</p>\n<p>Whenever one of the pages that details an individual's death is read, the relevant individual will die within the next 24 hours, in the exact manner described. While only three pages have ever been read, it is widely accepted that the reading of the page anomalously results in the written events occurring.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> SCP-5363 was discovered by MTF Alpha-1 (\"Red Right Hand\") upon a raid of a facility suspected to be connected to anomalous espionage. One of the task force's members read from a page detailing the death of Agent Jack Dawkins during the recovery process before handing it over to his captain. The next day, Agent Dawkins was killed in the manner detailed by SCP-5363. A brief interview and cross-reference determined SCP-5363's properties, and it was subsequently placed in containment. The relevant agents were amnesticized, and knowledge of SCP-5363 was restricted to exclusive Level 5 personnel and the O5 Council.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5363.1:</strong> One week after the initial containment of SCP-5363, an email was sent to all Level 5 personnel from a now-defunct address, containing a copy of SCP-5363's documentation. While knowledge of this document was kept from lower-ranking personnel, to prevent sudden panic, high tensions immediately rose between Level 5 personnel and the O5 Council. There were several demands that SCP-5363 be destroyed, culminating in an official proposal from the Decommissioning Department, signed by several personnel. The proposal was reviewed by the council, which engaged in a vote to override it.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>O5 Vote Overriding Decom. Dept.

Six Level 5 personnel immediately resigned following this announcement.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5363.2:</strong> On December 5th, 2010, a raid was conducted by the Chaos Insurgency on Site-03, in an attempt to gather vital Foundation intelligence. The incursion was successfully repelled, with multiple Insurgency agents being captured.</p>\n<p>Upon interrogation of the detained subjects, it was discovered that they were primarily seeking the location of SCP-5363. As the raid captain had been killed during the incident, it was unknown how the Insurgency learned of SCP-5363's existence. An internal investigation was immediately carried out to find a possible leak; none was found.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5363.3:</strong> Since the previous incident, five attacks have been carried out by hostile Groups of Interest against intelligence Sites, with the confirmed goal of locating SCP-5363.

Access to it is strictly forbidden except by unanimous approval of the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n**Description (Archived):** SCP-5363 is a sheaf of papers, stapled together in the top-left corner. The top sheet is a cover sheet that reads \"Special Termination Procedures.\"\n\n\n\nBehind the cover sheet, SCP-5363 is organized in sets of two pages. The first page in each set displays the name of a high-ranking, living member of Foundation personnel. The page behind it displays details on how the aforementioned individual will be killed. Whenever the cover sheet is lifted, SCP-5363 will generate a new section behind the existing ones. Currently, SCP-5363 has 22 pages, excluding the cover sheet.\n\n\n\nWhenever one of the pages that details an individual's death is read, the relevant individual will die within the next 24 hours, in the exact manner described. While only three pages have ever been read, it is widely accepted that the reading of the page anomalously results in the written events occurring.\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5363 was discovered by MTF Alpha-1 (\"Red Right Hand\") upon a raid of a facility suspected to be connected to anomalous espionage. One of the task force's members read from a page detailing the death of Agent Jack Dawkins during the recovery process before handing it over to his captain. The next day, Agent Dawkins was killed in the manner detailed by SCP-5363. A brief interview and cross-reference determined SCP-5363's properties, and it was subsequently placed in containment. The relevant agents were amnesticized, and knowledge of SCP-5363 was restricted to exclusive Level 5 personnel and the O5 Council.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5363.1:** One week after the initial containment of SCP-5363, an email was sent to all Level 5 personnel from a now-defunct address, containing a copy of SCP-5363's documentation. While knowledge of this document was kept from lower-ranking personnel, to prevent sudden panic, high tensions immediately rose between Level 5 personnel and the O5 Council. There were several demands that SCP-5363 be destroyed, culminating in an official proposal from the Decommissioning Department, signed by several personnel. The proposal was reviewed by the council, which engaged in a vote to override it.\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n**O5 Vote Overriding Decom. Dept.

Six Level 5 personnel immediately resigned following this announcement.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5363.2:** On December 5th, 2010, a raid was conducted by the Chaos Insurgency on Site-03, in an attempt to gather vital Foundation intelligence. The incursion was successfully repelled, with multiple Insurgency agents being captured.\n\n\n\nUpon interrogation of the detained subjects, it was discovered that they were primarily seeking the location of SCP-5363. As the raid captain had been killed during the incident, it was unknown how the Insurgency learned of SCP-5363's existence. An internal investigation was immediately carried out to find a possible leak; none was found.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5363.3:** Since the previous incident, five attacks have been carried out by hostile Groups of Interest against intelligence Sites, with the confirmed goal of locating SCP-5363. No captured individuals have divulged the source of their intelligence.\n\n\n\nA second proposal was sent from the Decommissioning Department, signed by a significantly higher number of personnel. It once again proposed the destruction of SCP-5363, this time with the additional grounds that its existence was resulting in collateral damage and deaths as enemy forces attempted to locate the object. With a 7-6 vote by the O5 Council, SCP-5363 was approved for decommissioning and transferred to Area-137.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5363.4:** ##red|[O5 ACCESS GRANTED]## The following message was sent from O5-2 to the rest of the O5 Council, prior to the planned transfer of SCP-5363 to the Decommissioning Department:\n\n\n\n> My fellow council members,\n\n> \n\n> I have always been in support of delegation and the belief that we can both control and trust those in our command to make the right decisions.

SCP-5398 was capable of regenerating lost cells at an accelerated rate.

Upon examination via the camera placed on its armband, it was seen that while the discoloration caused by the <em>necrotizing fasciitis</em> infection was visible, cell death was found to be heavily slowed. This resulted in SCP-5398's regenerative properties being capable of regenerating cells at a rate faster than the cell deaths. It was also seen that the infection was beginning to spread to further areas of SCP-5398's arm. The fail-safe for the procedure was immediately enacted.<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-5\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-5')\">5</a></sup> While the procedure was completed without any complications, upon regeneration, the limb was unchanged in regards to the infection. A state of emergency was called with regards to SCP-5398, and testing was expedited for the purpose of removing the <em>necrotizing fasciitis</em> bacteria within SCP-5398.

SCP-5398 is to be under inhalant anesthesia during testing.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5398 was a 16 year old male humanoid of Sri Lankan descent, formerly known as Mihindu Fonseca. SCP-5398 was capable of regenerating lost cells at an accelerated rate. While the rate of regeneration differed depending on the type of cell, it was found to regenerate at least 10 times the rate of baseline humans.\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** On March 13^^th^^, 2018, SCP-5398 was in a motor vehicle accident in Galle, Sri Lanka, which resulted in 4 casualties and 2 injured, including SCP-5398. Upon arrival at Asiri Hospital Galle, first responders and medical personnel began to report signs of accelerated regeneration. Foundation agents embedded within the hospital quickly used cover story Chi-42[[footnote]] Transfer to a different medical facility better equipped to respond to the specific injury and/or illness [[/footnote]] to extract SCP-5398 from the facility. Amnestics were used as needed. Foundation agents were able to confirm that SCP-5398 did possess enhanced regenerative capabilities during transport.\n\n\n\n**Testing:** \n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Testing Log\" hide=\"Close Testing Log\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n\n\n||~ Test Number ||~ Reason for Test ||~ Procedure ||~ Outcome ||~ Additional Notes ||\n\n|| Test #1 || Pain response || Pinch the left upper arm. || Standard response. || //All further testing is to be done under anesthetic. **-Researcher Guruge**// ||\n\n|| Test #2 || None; accidental || Dr. Gopallawa, RN, was to administer an intravenous anesthetic in preparation for an upcoming test. || Dr. Gopallawa was unable to inject said anesthetic.

SCP-5398 is to have the following provisional containment procedure revision enacted: --SCP-5398 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment chamber outside of testing.-- ##blue|SCP-5398 is to be kept in the anomaly medical ward for the duration of the current test.## || While the cell damage caused by the gastroenteritis was largely undone while infected, the symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea appeared unaffected. || //SCP-5398 has shown further non-cooperation regarding testing. Reason stated to be lack of post-procedure medication. Requesting said medications on demand. **-Dr. Gopallawa**\u00a0\u00a0Denied. Should uncooperative behavior escalate further, amnestic treatment has been approved. **-Site Director Chandawimala**// ||\n\n|| Test #27 || Ensure fail-safe for test #28 || Place a GPS tracking chip in SCP-5398's left wrist.

The fail-safe for test #28 has been confirmed functional. Awaiting Ethics Committee approval. **-Researcher Guruge**// ||\n\n|| Test #28 || Reaction to a foreign biological entity destroying and residing within cells || An incision is to be made in SCP-5398's left inner elbow. A live sample of //necrotizing fasciitis//[[footnote]] Commonly known as flesh-eating bacteria [[/footnote]] is then to be applied to the wound. SCP-5398 is to be given an armband equipped with a camera capable of microscopic zoom. Previously used provisional containment procedures are to be used. Test --pending approval-- ##blue| approved## by the Ethics Committee. || See Addendum-5398-1. || //What have we done? **-Researcher Guruge**// ||\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum-5398-1:** 26 hours following test #28 (see **Testing**), SCP-5398 began to report increasingly great pain from its left inner elbow. Upon examination via the camera placed on its armband, it was seen that while the discoloration caused by the //necrotizing fasciitis// infection was visible, cell death was found to be heavily slowed. This resulted in SCP-5398's regenerative properties being capable of regenerating cells at a rate faster than the cell deaths. It was also seen that the infection was beginning to spread to further areas of SCP-5398's arm. The fail-safe for the procedure was immediately enacted.[[footnote]] Complete amputation of the left arm [[/footnote]] While the procedure was completed without any complications, upon regeneration, the limb was unchanged in regards to the infection. A state of emergency was called with regards to SCP-5398, and testing was expedited for the purpose of removing the //necrotizing fasciitis// bacteria within SCP-5398. SCP-5398 was also to remain in its provisional containment during this time.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Emergency Testing Log\" hide=\"Close Emergency Testing Log\"]]\n\n\n\nThe Ethics Committee has deemed the content of this testing log to be unessential in displaying the mistreatment of SCP-5398. The following is information relating to the testing log that was originally present to ensure understanding of further sections of this document.\n\n\n\n**Total Emergency Tests Done:** 57\n\n\n\n**Time From Test #1 to Test #57:** 3 Days\n\n\n\n**Percentage of SCP-5398's skin, fat, and muscle tissue infected with //necrotizing fasciitis//:** 100%\n\n\n\n//It appears that only non-biological bodies can be removed from SCP-5398. **-Researcher Guruge**//\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum-5398-2:** On March 29^^th^^, 2018, the following Decommissioning Department mandate was approved by the Ethics Committee:\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Open Mandate\" hide=\"Close Mandate\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; background:#DFFFF3 url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n\n\n= __DECOMMISSIONING DEPARTMENT TERMINATION REQUEST__\n\n\n\nITEM TO BE TERMINATED: SCP-5398 \n\n\n\nREASON FOR TERMINATION: As of yet, there is currently no way to remove the //necrotizing fasciitis// infection from SCP-5398, and is theorized to be impossible (see **Addendum-5398-1**). As inhalant anesthetic is not as potent as intravenous, SCP-5398 is constantly suffering. There is the additional issue of SCP-5398 being unable to be properly tested, as we would no metric to gauge the rate of regeneration coupled with the rate of cell death.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED TERMINATION METHOD: Ingested botulinum toxin. This allows the termination to be unaffected by SCP-5398's anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n= ETHICS COMMITTEE VOTE SUMMARY:\n\n||~ YEA\u00a0\u00a0||~ NAY\u00a0\u00a0||~ ABSTAIN ||\n\n|| 9 VOTES || 4 VOTES || 2 VOTES ||\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n||~ STATUS ||\n\n|| ##057800|APPROVED## ||\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nSCP-5398 was terminated shortly after SCP-5398's research team received the above mandate via ingested botulinum toxin, as was recommended.\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Notice:** The following section was added to this document following the decision to preserve it.\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n\n\n++++ Afterword\n\n\n\nI am Eleonora Grosse, the, at the time of SCP-5398's termination, Chairwoman of the Ethics Committee. Following the reading of the prior sections of this document, you are most likely appalled by the actions of the Foundation, and rightfully so. That is the reason why I, personally, am editing this document, to apologize for what we have done. Apologize for the medications it was refused, for the allowance of test #28, and especially for the termination of an otherwise benign anomaly. I have not only come to apologize, but also show you what precautions have been taken to ensure this is not repeated. There will always be lapses in ethical judgement. What we must do is remember them, and prevent them.\n\n\n\n-- Elenora Grosse, Chairwoman, Ethics Committee\n\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Open Attached Document\" hide=\"Hide Attached Document\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; background:#DFFFF3 url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n\n\n= __ETHICS COMMITTEE MANDATE #9173__\n\n\n\nFrom this moment forward, all baseline testing of self-repairing humanoid SCP subjects is to follow similar procedure as to those listed below.\n\n\n\nNote: All of the following tests are to be done by automated systems to ensure swift execution of the procedure. This is done to ensure the regenerative capabilities of the SCP subject do not interfere with the procedure.\n\n\n\n||~ Reason for Test ||~ Procedure ||\n\n|| Pain Response || A 21-23 gauge syringe[[footnote]] .63 to .83mm in outer diameter [[/footnote]] is to be placed within a blood vessel. If possible, 10ml of blood are to be taken for testing. The subject is then to be questioned whether this caused them any pain or discomfort. If yes, all further testing is to be done under anesthesia. ||\n\n|| Epidermal Regeneration || A 5cm square is to be removed from the epidermis. Time from removal to full regeneration is to be recorded. ||\n\n|| Burn Regeneration || An end of a small copper rod is to be heated to 70^^o^^C, and subsequently held to the epidermis of the subject until a first degree burn manifests. Time from burn appearance to full regeneration is to be recorded. ||\n\n|| Bone Realignment || A bone is to be dislocated. Time from dislocation to relocation is to be recorded. Should the time surpass 5 minutes, the bone is to be manually relocated and treated as a non-anomalous dislocation. ||\n\n\n\nThe SCP subject is to be informed of these tests prior to the enactment of the procedure. Should the subject make requests regarding the location of the tests, they are to be followed unless deemed unsafe. The SCP subject is to be allowed access to pain suppressing medication following tests as needed.\n\n\n\nAdditional testing requires Ethics Committee approval. Tests may also be requested to be added to the prior list, however, this will also require Ethics Committee approval.\n\n\n\nFor an illustration of properly adhering to this mandate, see [[[SCP-4820]]].\n\n\n\nFAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: REASSIGNMENT, DEMOTION, AND/OR TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-5397]]] | SCP-5398 | [[[SCP-5399]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["scp-4820", "scp-5397", "scp-5399", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "scp": "SCP-5398", "scp_number": 5398, "series": "decommissioned", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "alive", "decommissioned", "decommissioning-dept", "humanoid", "sapient", "scp", "self-repairing"], "title": "SCP-5398", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5398"}, "SCP-5559": {"created_at": "2020-03-13T02:20:00", "creator": "Calibold", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "Calibold", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/calibold", "comment": "", "date": "2020-03-13T02:20:00"}, {"author": "Calibold", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/calibold", "comment": "Added tags: _delicious, jam-con2020.

If necessary, false health code violations and other illegal activity may be falsely attributed to SCP-5559-1 instances.</p>\n<p>The current goal regarding SCP-5559 is to locate PoI-3737 (\"Ethan\") and <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">convince him to cease SCP-5559's operation, and relocate to strictly anomalous locales</span> shut down all operations regarding his business, effectively decommissioning SCP-5559 (See Addendum 5559.1 and Decom. Proposal 5559).</p>\n<p><strong>Description (Archived):</strong> SCP-5559 is a phenomenon in which SCP-5559-1 instances will spontaneously appear across the United States. SCP-5559 itself is self-containing, and the generation of SCP-5559-1 instances is generally unacknowledged.</p>\n<p>SCP-5559-1 instances are small restaurant outlets, named \"Ethan's Eateries\". Each SCP-5559-1 instance spontaneously appears with existing staff, and requires no setup between manifestation and opening. Each SCP-5559-1 instance serves a wide variety of anomalous foodstuffs, a complete list of which is available upon request.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5559.1:</strong> Shortly after the discovery of SCP-5559, Captain Antoine Daniels of Lambda-14 received a request from <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ambrose-restaurant-hub\">GoI-116</a> (\"Ambrose Restaurants\") to discuss SCP-5559 with Chaz Ambrose, founder of the group. Notably, Lambda-14 had interacted with Ambrose Restaurants previously, albeit mostly with conflicting interests at hand.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Evening, Chaz.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Antoine. Been a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> To what do I owe the pleasure?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> I'm gonna cut to the chase here. You've heard of Ethan's Eateries, yes?</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Mhm.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Now, I'm sure you want them contained, right? Kept out of sight from the public, but letting them operate in places like <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub\">Portlands</a> or whatever.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Right.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> I know it's not your MO, but I'm willing to work with you on this if we can find some way to get rid of them completely.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Let me guess, they're cutting in on your business.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Bingo. I want them gone even more than you do. They have restaurants popping up every other day, their sticky fingers all across the states. Anomalous food has always been my thing. But whoever this Ethan fellow is, he's draining all my patrons.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Right. So why should we work with you on this?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Couple reasons. First, I'm motivated. I'm in it for me, but we have the same goals. Second, I have contacts, resources, and a reputation. We both know the Foundation isn't very well-liked. You won't be able to get some places or reach some people.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Mkay. Is that all you wanted to tell me?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> I guess so.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Well, I'll bring it up with my superiors, but I think we can handle this on our own.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Look, I'm willing to cut a deal with you guys. What's something that I can do for you?</p>\n<p><em>[A few moments of silence.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> I might have an idea. I'll have to run it by my superiors first, but it might make it worth it on our end.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> I'm listening.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> If we get rid of Ethan's business entirely, you'll provide both assistance to the operation, but you'll also have to cut down your business operations.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> What do you mean?</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> I'm suggesting that you restrict your operations to purely anomalous locales.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> That would be a big shift for us. And I'm not sure how Marius would feel about it</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> It might not be such a big change, honestly. It's where you mostly run anyway, and when you do try to spread out, it always results in unnecessary conflict with folks like us or the GOC. It's easier for us, and it's easier for both you guys.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Well, I'm interested. <em>[Stands up and sticks out hand.]</em> I'll take it to Marius, but I think we can outline an agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> <em>[Takes hand and shakes it.]</em> Might be nice to actually work with my favorite restaurant for a change, eh?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> And nice to work with my favorite task force.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following the interview, Captain Daniels submitted a proposal to the <a href=\"/scp-4456\">Decommissioning Department</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<h2 id=\"toc0\"><span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>SCP Object Decommissioning Proposal Form</strong></span></span></h2>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-5559\n<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>\n<p><strong>Head Researcher:</strong> Dr. Aiden Reyes</p>\n<p><strong>Supporting Personnel:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Captain Antoine Daniels - Representing MTF Lambda-14 (\"One-Star Reviewers\")</em></li>\n<li><em>A. Ferril - Representing Foundation Treasury and Finances Dept.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Please check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:</strong><br/>\n\u2611 Excessively High Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario<br/>\n\u2610 Excessive Danger<br/>\n\u2610 Ability to Decom. Apollyon-Class Object<br/>\n\u2611 Expense<br/>\n\u2610 Ethical Concerns Over Necessary Containment<br/>\n\u2610 Legal Concerns<br/>\n\u2610 High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s):<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">____</span>)<br/>\n\u2611 Other (please state): Should we agree to Decommission SCP-5559, Chaz Ambrose and Marius of GoI-116 (\"Ambrose Restaurants\") have agreed to rescind their operations from the non-anomalous community as well as assist in the containment/neutralization of SCP-5559, in return for the Decommissioning of SCP-5559. <em>- Captain Daniels, Chaz Ambrose, Marius</em></p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Admittedly, SCP-5559 would not normally present a significant enough risk for us to consider Decommissioning outright. However, not only does it still remain an incredibly high chance of lifting the Veil, third-party organization Ambrose Restaurants has agreed to both assist in the neutralization as well as to cease their own operations that represent a threat to normalcy, in exchange for the Decommissioning of SCP-5559. This opportunity is clearly a beneficial one, and should be taken, in my opinion. <em>-Captain Daniels</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Decommissioning Proposal was signed and approved by Director Bold, and an agreement was written outlining the conditions of both the SCP Foundation and Ambrose Restaurants in the joint operations. A full transcript of the agreement is available upon request.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 5559.2 (Project JAMCON):</strong> Following the agreement with Ambrose Restaurants, a multi-step project, known as JAMCON<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>, was devised in order to neutralize Ethan's Eateries and, by extension, SCP-5559.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 (Operation Telephone):</strong> A high-ranking Ambrose employee, with proof of employment by Ambrose Restaurants, was sent to an instance of SCP-5559-1 to try and find a contact line with the owners of Ethan's Eateries. The employee was under the guise of a former and disgruntled Ambrose employee, codenamed \"Ronald King,\" hoping to sell trade secrets to Ethan's Eateries.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Excuse me, sir?</p>\n<p><strong>Employee:</strong> Oh! How may I help you?</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Is there any way I could speak with your management please?</p>\n<p><strong>Employee:</strong> <em>[Sighs.]</em> Sir, you could at least <em>try</em> our food before you make a complaint.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Oh, uh, I'm not here to make a complaint, ma'am. I'm actually hoping to speak to corporate.</p>\n<p><strong>Employee:</strong> Oh! My bad then, I'll grab our manager.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> No worries. You seem pretty frustrated anyway, what's going on?</p>\n<p><strong>Employee:</strong> Just bureaucracy, PR, all that. I swear we're just getting trolls, all sorts of random folks keep leaving one-star reviews on the place. Nobody's wanting to come here, and now we're getting a surprise inspection?</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Oh. Um, yeah. Sounds rough.</p>\n<p><strong>Employee:</strong> Sorry, just venting. I'll get the manager, my bad. You can have a seat while you wait, is there anything you'd like?</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Well, I was just looking at your menu. May I try your Sahara Spring and maybe some Cutesy Cake please?</p>\n<p><strong>Employee:</strong> Sure thing.</p>\n<p><em>[King sits at a table. After a few minutes, his meal is delivered.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Employee:</strong> Manager's just making a phone call, he'll be out in a few.</p>\n<p><em>[After a few minutes, a man sits down across from King.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Are you the manager?</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> That I would be! What can I do for you?</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> I'm actually hoping to contact your corporate branch or your owner.</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> You talking about Ethan?</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Yes I am. <em>[Sips Sahara Spring.]</em> I'd like to- I'd like- sorry, do you have some water?</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> <em>[Laughs.]</em> Should've read the description, pal! Ah, it's just a little joke, just makes you even more thirsty.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> It's certainly interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Sure is! You know the best part? It just means they buy more drinks from us!</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> That is\u2026 a business strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Ah, it still tastes good. I see you got some Cutesy Cake, give it a shot! Got that recipe right from JGT!</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> JGT?</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Don't know what it is either, but they know how to bake a cake! Go on, have a bite!</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> <em>[Takes a forkful of cake, then gags.]</em> Holy- is that just straight sugar?</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> You get used to it, and then you'll start tasting the strawberries and stuff!</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> I have to say, a lot of your operations seem\u2026 mildly unethical? Or at least manipulative.</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> <em>[Shrugs]</em> That's just business, partner.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Well, I'm not here to complain.</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Yes, yes, you wanted to talk to Ethan! I think I can help you, though I know he might not have time. The man must be working constantly! You know the saying, busy as a butterfly.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> You mean- never mind. Would you know how to contact him or his headquarters?</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Oh yeah. He has an office in New York, I think. Might I ask what this is all about?</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> I'm from Ambrose Restaurants, actually.</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Really?</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Well, I don't work for them anymore. We're downsizing pretty heavily, actually. I could go on and on about how crappy it is that I got fired, but the end result is, if I can't beat them, I'll join them.</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Oh! Well, I'm glad you're interested, we need all the help we can get. It's been hectic lately. The Foundation's been on our back constantly, no room for growth at all, and I know Ambrose is pissed that we're taking his customers.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Yeah, well he's losing more than just customers now.</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Ooh, do tell.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Ambrose has his own secrets. You really thought that I'd just take all this lying down? <em>[Passes a sheet of paper to the manager.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Is that-</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> One of Ambrose's original recipes, yes. And there's plenty more where that came from.</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Well, well, well. A fellow man of business.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> I assume Ethan's gonna be interested in this?</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Oh, I'm sure he will.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Wonderfu- the <em>hell</em>, why is everything pink?</p>\n<p><strong>Manager:</strong> Ah, that would be the cake. Don't worry, it'll wear off.</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Holy- you know what, just give me the address.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>King received an address for Ethan's headquarters, allowing Project JAMCON to proceed into the second phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 (Operation Tablecloth):</strong> Unit 1 of MTF Lambda-14, along with Chaz Ambrose, Marius, and Ronald King, were sent to the given address, with the goal of detaining Ethan and halting his operations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Stay sharp. We don't know what we're dealing with here.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> The man's a chef, Daniels, and not a very good one. I don't see what we have to worry about.</p>\n<p><em>[The party enters the entrance hall of the building, which is unlit. Immediately, the doors shut behind them and the lights turn on, revealing multiple armed guards around the perimeter of the room.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> Huh.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Nice going, Ambrose.</p>\n<p><em>[A man emerges from a pair of doors on the other side of the room, wearing a chef's outfit.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Ethan, I presume?</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> That's right! Welcome to my office!</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> A bit unwelcoming to visitors, to be honest.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Oh please. Some guy comes in from Ambrose, with a pathetic sob story about revenge, and I'm supposed to just think that everything's cool?</p>\n<p><strong>King:</strong> Hey, they came up with that plan, not me.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> But I'm glad to have you! Well, the Foundation I didn't need, but whatever. But Ambrose and Marius\u2026 <em>[Claps hands.]</em> Well, you're the ones who've really been causing problems for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> <em>We're</em> the ones- We were here first! You're the one causing problems!</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Oh, I'm not denying it! But that's just business. Which is why I have to kill you, I'm afraid.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Wait, what? That's a pretty quick escalation.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I mean, I have to cut out the competition! With Ambrose and Marius out of the picture, their company will just fall apart, leaving me with a monopoly that he used to have.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> And the rest of us have to die because\u2026?</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> You're bothering me almost as much as them. Speaking of which, you're still bothering me, so I'm afraid the time for talking is-</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Wait!</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I just said we're done talking, what do you want?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> You'll like this, hold on. <em>[Turns to Marius. The two of them whisper for a few moments.]</em> I have a better idea.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> A better idea than just killing you and removing all competition and interference?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> A contest. A bake-off.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> You have to be joking.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I agree with that guy. What on Earth are you even talking about?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Hear me out. The two of us have a bake-off, at the Portlands Stadium. I win, I get all of your assets, locations, and whatever. If you win, you get all of mine.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> That sounds like a far more risky option for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> But if you just kill me, everything stays the same for you. But if you win the contest, you get to take all of my restaurants, employees, recipes, marketing, money, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> There's still a high chance of losing for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Well, not if you're as great as you think you are. If you're really the better chef, then you should be able to win, right?</p>\n<p><em>[A few moments of silences.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Okay, I'll bite!</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> Really?</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I mean, you're right! I'm the better chef, so I'll easily win!</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> So\u2026 you're letting us go?</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I mean, for now. But I expect to see you in Three Portlands on\u2026 let's say Saturday at noon?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Uh, sure. Great.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Awesome! See you on Saturday!</p>\n<p><em>[Ethan claps his hands once, and the lights turn off. The party exits the building.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> So, Daniels. You any good in a kitchen?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Phase 3 (Unplanned):</strong> The following Saturday, Ambrose, Marius and Unit 1 of MTF Lambda-14 travelled to Three Portlands Stadium for the bake-off. The two contestants were supplied with various ingredients, both anomalous and non-anomalous, in order to create their dishes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>[Captain Daniels, Ambrose, and Marius are on one side of the stadium at a large cooking station. Ethan and two other individuals are located at the other end with their own station.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> So how does this work, exactly?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Haven't done one of these in a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Wait, you mean this is an actual thing that people do? You've done this before?</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> Oh yeah, there's a committee and everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> So what are the rules though?</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> You see that panel over there? <em>[Points to table with five individuals sitting behind it.]</em> Those are the judges. Basically, anything is fair game here, as long as you keep to your own station. The judges each rate your dish out of ten after the two hours. Make sense?</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> That's all?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> It's a bake-off, what else do you need?</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Fair enough.</p>\n<p><em>[People begin entering the stadium. After several minutes, a woman walks up to the podium.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Welcome, all! Today, we have a special show for all of you! <em>[Crowd applauds.]</em> Our guest tonight, I'm sure you've seen him around, but he's just getting started! Please welcome Ethan, from Ethan's Eateries!</p>\n<p><em>[Ethan stands up and bows. Crowd cheers and applauds loudly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> As for our other competitor, he needs no introduction from me! Put your hands together for Chaz Ambrose!</p>\n<p><em>[Ambrose stands and waves to the crowd, which starts chanting his name and applauding.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Someone's a fan favorite.</p>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Let's go over the rules real quick! The contestants have two hours to make their dish, with help from two partners, after which the judges will taste and score them! Whoever has the highest score wins the others' company! Let's bring the contestants up here, shall we?</p>\n<p><em>[Ambrose and Ethan both walk up to a table in front of the podium. The announcer sets a sheet of paper down.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Now, this is a totally binding contract here, a geas. Both of you agree to the terms, yes?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Yes.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Sure do.</p>\n<p><em>[The two of them sign the contract, and return to their stations.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> The conditions are set, the contestants are ready, and the bake-off starts\u2026 now!</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Alright, what do you want me to do?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> We're putting together a Forch\u00e9 Bon for the main course, grab those two bottles at the end of the table and mix them in a bowl. Marius is handling the side dishes, just hand him anything if he needs it.</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> <em>[Pulls out measuring cups and begins mixing various ingredients.]</em> I need some sugar!</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> <em>[Pulls out a container.]</em> Here!</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> To the right of that! That's Meiic salt right there, the sugar!</p>\n<p><em>[Daniels gives the container of sugar to Marius and starts mixing ingredients in the bowl.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> How are you so sure we'll win this?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Trust me, he can't win. There's one thing a great chef must have, and Ethan doesn't have it.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> How are you sure he doesn't have it? What is it anyway?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> You'll see! For now, stay concentrated. <em>[Ambrose pours an unknown mixture into his pot, causing it to briefly distort spacetime above it.]</em> Keep up the good work!</p>\n<p><em>[Extraneous logs redacted for brevity.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Time! Put everything down! Let's start with Ethan, what do you have?</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> The main course, we have a Brimmerulic leg, saut\u00e9ed in antimemetic Chrerl sauce. The sauce itself is forgotten, but combined with the leg's taste is nullified, leaving a strong yet appealing taste. Our side dishes consist of a non-Euclidean fruit rings, topped with a simple sweet onion sauce, and prismic oil poured over an invisible pasta, forming the illusion of a suspended liquid, shaped into a sort of web.</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> Curses.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> What's wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> That's one of our dishes. He stole our recipe.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Patience, it only helps us.</p>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Very interesting! Now, let's come over to Ambrose's station, what have you prepared?</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> For our main course, this is a strawberry pastry of the Forch\u00e9 Bon style. Now, you'll notice that the pastry itself is slightly shaking, which is the result of a small animation enhancement, similar to golems. It's not sentient, and I promise it won't lay eggs inside of you- <em>[Crowd chuckles.]</em> -but it does allow for an enhancement in the actual texture of the meal, an aspect of dining not often focused on. It's frosted with a vanilla-and-Orsech cream. As for our side dishes, you can see we've placed a ring of gelatin cubes around the dish, which is actually one cube, existing simultaneously around and centered upon the plate itself. And we have a temporal salad, made from lettuce, tomatoes, and kleimic cheese. After eating a bite, you'll be taken a few seconds into the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Well, these are a pair of very fancy dishes we have, but it's up to the judges to decide which one is better. Ethan, please give yours to the judges for scoring.</p>\n<p><em>[Ethan walks to the panel and puts his plate in front of the judges, who each taste a small amount of each course. After a few moments, the judges write on dry-erase boards and hold them up.]</em></p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>6</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> Ethan comes out with a decent score of thirty-two! But let's see what Ambrose has to offer!</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Not too bad, not too bad.</p>\n<p><em>[Ambrose walks to the panel and gives the judges his dish. They sample his meal<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> and reveal their score.]</em></p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Announcer:</strong> And Ambrose comes out with a score of forty-one, making him the winner!</p>\n<p><em>[Crowd cheers and applauses wildly. Ambrose and Marius hug each other and laugh.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Impossible!</p>\n<p><em>[The crowd dies down.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I did everything right, I even used your recipe! <em>[Crowd gasps.]</em> Oh, shut up you lot, there's no rules against it! But I was using a tried and true recipe, while you guys slapped something together on the spot!</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Oh please, Ethan. Did you really think I'd just leave all my best recipes lying around? You may have gotten most of the instructions, but what makes my best recipes truly special- <em>[Ambrose taps his forehead.]</em> -stays right up here.</p>\n<p><em>[Crowd gasps and applauds briefly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> You can copy my recipes all you want, but you'll never be able to recreate what makes them amazing. If I'd written out the most disgusting meal in my recipes, that's exactly what you would have made, and you would never know how to make it better. You're not a chef, and you don't know what makes good food!</p>\n<p><em>[Crowd applauses wildly.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Fine then! Take my restaurants. There's other ways to make money anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Not where you're going, Ethan. I'm taking you in.</p>\n<p><strong>Ethan:</strong> Cute. But I'm not going with you, I'm afraid. <em>[Pulls out a wrapped piece of gum and starts chewing.]</em> I've still learned a few tricks with food, even if you don't always eat it.</p>\n<p><em>[Ethan blows a bubble out of his gum, which pops, and he vanishes. Brief silence, followed by the crowd cheering again. Daniels shakes both Ambrose's and Marius' hands.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> I guess that's that.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> We'll be sure to close down Ethan's stores. I figure we can sell the real estate for a good price, but I'm just glad to have him gone.</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> Plus we can take down that <em>awful</em> logo, it looks like a backwards 3 humping another backwards 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> And you guys will keep your end of the bargain?</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> We're men of our words, Daniels. But\u2026</p>\n<p><strong>Daniels:</strong> Marius.</p>\n<p><strong>Marius:</strong> I'm kidding, we'll keep it on the down-low. But I'm sure we'll see each other again.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> I still don't trust you two.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambrose:</strong> Then everything's back to normal, I suppose.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel:</strong> It would seem so. Although I don't think we've seen the last of our dear friend Ethan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following Ambrose Restaurants' acquisition of Ethan's Eateries, SCP-5559 has ceased, and SCP-5559-1 instances have been decommissioned.

[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#lambda-14 MTF Lambda-14] (\"One Star Reviewers\") is monitoring SCP-5559 and interfering with SCP-5559-1 operations when necessary.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the most effective method of containment is to mass review SCP-5559-1 instances and to utilize all available methods to deter the populace from investigating these locations. If necessary, false health code violations and other illegal activity may be falsely attributed to SCP-5559-1 instances.\n\n\n\nThe current goal regarding SCP-5559 is to locate PoI-3737 (\"Ethan\") and --convince him to cease SCP-5559's operation, and relocate to strictly anomalous locales-- shut down all operations regarding his business, effectively decommissioning SCP-5559 (See Addendum 5559.1 and Decom. Proposal 5559).\n\n\n\n**Description (Archived):** SCP-5559 is a phenomenon in which SCP-5559-1 instances will spontaneously appear across the United States. SCP-5559 itself is self-containing, and the generation of SCP-5559-1 instances is generally unacknowledged.\n\n\n\nSCP-5559-1 instances are small restaurant outlets, named \"Ethan's Eateries\". Each SCP-5559-1 instance spontaneously appears with existing staff, and requires no setup between manifestation and opening. Each SCP-5559-1 instance serves a wide variety of anomalous foodstuffs, a complete list of which is available upon request.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5559.1:** Shortly after the discovery of SCP-5559, Captain Antoine Daniels of Lambda-14 received a request from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ambrose-restaurant-hub GoI-116] (\"Ambrose Restaurants\") to discuss SCP-5559 with Chaz Ambrose, founder of the group. Notably, Lambda-14 had interacted with Ambrose Restaurants previously, albeit mostly with conflicting interests at hand.\n\n\n\n> **Daniels:** Evening, Chaz.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Antoine. Been a while.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** To what do I owe the pleasure?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** I'm gonna cut to the chase here. You've heard of Ethan's Eateries, yes?\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Mhm.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Now, I'm sure you want them contained, right? Kept out of sight from the public, but letting them operate in places like [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-portlands-hub Portlands] or whatever.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Right.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** I know it's not your MO, but I'm willing to work with you on this if we can find some way to get rid of them completely.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Let me guess, they're cutting in on your business.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Bingo. I want them gone even more than you do. They have restaurants popping up every other day, their sticky fingers all across the states. Anomalous food has always been my thing. But whoever this Ethan fellow is, he's draining all my patrons.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Right. So why should we work with you on this?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Couple reasons. First, I'm motivated. I'm in it for me, but we have the same goals. Second, I have contacts, resources, and a reputation. We both know the Foundation isn't very well-liked. You won't be able to get some places or reach some people.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Mkay. Is that all you wanted to tell me?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** I guess so.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Well, I'll bring it up with my superiors, but I think we can handle this on our own.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Look, I'm willing to cut a deal with you guys. What's something that I can do for you?\n\n> \n\n> //[A few moments of silence.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** I might have an idea. I'll have to run it by my superiors first, but it might make it worth it on our end.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** I'm listening.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** If we get rid of Ethan's business entirely, you'll provide both assistance to the operation, but you'll also have to cut down your business operations.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** What do you mean?\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** I'm suggesting that you restrict your operations to purely anomalous locales.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** That would be a big shift for us. And I'm not sure how Marius would feel about it\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** It might not be such a big change, honestly. It's where you mostly run anyway, and when you do try to spread out, it always results in unnecessary conflict with folks like us or the GOC. It's easier for us, and it's easier for both you guys.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Well, I'm interested. //[Stands up and sticks out hand.]// I'll take it to Marius, but I think we can outline an agreement.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** //[Takes hand and shakes it.]// Might be nice to actually work with my favorite restaurant for a change, eh?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** And nice to work with my favorite task force.\n\n\n\nFollowing the interview, Captain Daniels submitted a proposal to the [[[SCP-4456|Decommissioning Department]]].\n\n\n\n> [[=]]\n\n> ++ __**SCP Object Decommissioning Proposal Form**__\n\n> [[/=]]\n\n> **Item #:** SCP-5559\n\n> \n\n> **Object Class:** Keter\n\n> \n\n> **Head Researcher:** Dr. Aiden Reyes\n\n> \n\n> **Supporting Personnel:**\n\n> * //Captain Antoine Daniels - Representing MTF Lambda-14 (\"One-Star Reviewers\")//\n\n> * //A.

Apollyon-Class Object\n\n> \u2611 Expense\n\n> \u2610 Ethical Concerns Over Necessary Containment\n\n> \u2610 Legal Concerns\n\n> \u2610 High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s):@@____@@)\n\n> \u2611 Other (please state): Should we agree to Decommission SCP-5559, Chaz Ambrose and Marius of GoI-116 (\"Ambrose Restaurants\") have agreed to rescind their operations from the non-anomalous community as well as assist in the containment/neutralization of SCP-5559, in return for the Decommissioning of SCP-5559. //- Captain Daniels, Chaz Ambrose, Marius//\n\n> \n\n> **Summary:** Admittedly, SCP-5559 would not normally present a significant enough risk for us to consider Decommissioning outright. However, not only does it still remain an incredibly high chance of lifting the Veil, third-party organization Ambrose Restaurants has agreed to both assist in the neutralization as well as to cease their own operations that represent a threat to normalcy, in exchange for the Decommissioning of SCP-5559. This opportunity is clearly a beneficial one, and should be taken, in my opinion. //-Captain Daniels//\n\n\n\nThe Decommissioning Proposal was signed and approved by Director Bold, and an agreement was written outlining the conditions of both the SCP Foundation and Ambrose Restaurants in the joint operations. A full transcript of the agreement is available upon request.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5559.2 (Project JAMCON):** Following the agreement with Ambrose Restaurants, a multi-step project, known as JAMCON[[footnote]]Joint Ambrose-MTF Containment Oversight and Neutralization.[[/footnote]], was devised in order to neutralize Ethan's Eateries and, by extension, SCP-5559.\n\n\n\n**Phase 1 (Operation Telephone):** A high-ranking Ambrose employee, with proof of employment by Ambrose Restaurants, was sent to an instance of SCP-5559-1 to try and find a contact line with the owners of Ethan's Eateries. The employee was under the guise of a former and disgruntled Ambrose employee, codenamed \"Ronald King,\" hoping to sell trade secrets to Ethan's Eateries.\n\n\n\n> **King:** Excuse me, sir?\n\n> \n\n> **Employee:** Oh! How may I help you?\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Is there any way I could speak with your management please?\n\n> \n\n> **Employee:** //[Sighs.]// Sir, you could at least //try// our food before you make a complaint.\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Oh, uh, I'm not here to make a complaint, ma'am. I'm actually hoping to speak to corporate.\n\n> \n\n> **Employee:** Oh! My bad then, I'll grab our manager.\n\n> \n\n> **King:** No worries. You seem pretty frustrated anyway, what's going on?\n\n> \n\n> **Employee:** Just bureaucracy, PR, all that. I swear we're just getting trolls, all sorts of random folks keep leaving one-star reviews on the place. Nobody's wanting to come here, and now we're getting a surprise inspection?\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Oh. Um, yeah. Sounds rough.\n\n> \n\n> **Employee:** Sorry, just venting. I'll get the manager, my bad. You can have a seat while you wait, is there anything you'd like?\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Well, I was just looking at your menu. May I try your Sahara Spring and maybe some Cutesy Cake please?\n\n> \n\n> **Employee:** Sure thing.\n\n> \n\n> //[King sits at a table. After a few minutes, his meal is delivered.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Employee:** Manager's just making a phone call, he'll be out in a few.\n\n> \n\n> //[After a few minutes, a man sits down across from King.]//\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Are you the manager?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** That I would be! What can I do for you?\n\n> \n\n> **King:** I'm actually hoping to contact your corporate branch or your owner.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** You talking about Ethan?\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Yes I am. //[Sips Sahara Spring.]// I'd like to- I'd like- sorry, do you have some water?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** //[Laughs.]// Should've read the description, pal! Ah, it's just a little joke, just makes you even more thirsty. \n\n> \n\n> **King:** It's certainly interesting.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Sure is! You know the best part? It just means they buy more drinks from us!\n\n> \n\n> **King:** That is... a business strategy.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Ah, it still tastes good. I see you got some Cutesy Cake, give it a shot! Got that recipe right from JGT!\n\n> \n\n> **King:** JGT?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Don't know what it is either, but they know how to bake a cake! Go on, have a bite!\n\n> \n\n> **King:** //[Takes a forkful of cake, then gags.]// Holy- is that just straight sugar?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** You get used to it, and then you'll start tasting the strawberries and stuff!\n\n> \n\n> **King:** I have to say, a lot of your operations seem... mildly unethical? Or at least manipulative.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** //[Shrugs]// That's just business, partner.\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Well, I'm not here to complain.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Yes, yes, you wanted to talk to Ethan! I think I can help you, though I know he might not have time. The man must be working constantly! You know the saying, busy as a butterfly.\n\n> \n\n> **King:** You mean- never mind. Would you know how to contact him or his headquarters?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Oh yeah. He has an office in New York, I think. Might I ask what this is all about?\n\n> \n\n> **King:** I'm from Ambrose Restaurants, actually.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Really?\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Well, I don't work for them anymore. We're downsizing pretty heavily, actually. I could go on and on about how crappy it is that I got fired, but the end result is, if I can't beat them, I'll join them.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Oh! Well, I'm glad you're interested, we need all the help we can get. It's been hectic lately. The Foundation's been on our back constantly, no room for growth at all, and I know Ambrose is pissed that we're taking his customers.\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Yeah, well he's losing more than just customers now.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Ooh, do tell.\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Ambrose has his own secrets. You really thought that I'd just take all this lying down? //[Passes a sheet of paper to the manager.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Is that-\n\n> \n\n> **King:** One of Ambrose's original recipes, yes. And there's plenty more where that came from.\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Well, well, well. A fellow man of business.\n\n> \n\n> **King:** I assume Ethan's gonna be interested in this?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Oh, I'm sure he will.\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Wonderfu- the //hell//, why is everything pink?\n\n> \n\n> **Manager:** Ah, that would be the cake. Don't worry, it'll wear off.\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Holy- you know what, just give me the address.\n\n\n\nKing received an address for Ethan's headquarters, allowing Project JAMCON to proceed into the second phase.\n\n\n\n**Phase 2 (Operation Tablecloth):** Unit 1 of MTF Lambda-14, along with Chaz Ambrose, Marius, and Ronald King, were sent to the given address, with the goal of detaining Ethan and halting his operations.\n\n\n\n> **Daniels:** Stay sharp. We don't know what we're dealing with here.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** The man's a chef, Daniels, and not a very good one. I don't see what we have to worry about.\n\n> \n\n> //[The party enters the entrance hall of the building, which is unlit. Immediately, the doors shut behind them and the lights turn on, revealing multiple armed guards around the perimeter of the room.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** Huh.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Nice going, Ambrose.\n\n> \n\n> //[A man emerges from a pair of doors on the other side of the room, wearing a chef's outfit.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Ethan, I presume?\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** That's right! Welcome to my office!\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** A bit unwelcoming to visitors, to be honest.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** Oh please. Some guy comes in from Ambrose, with a pathetic sob story about revenge, and I'm supposed to just think that everything's cool?\n\n> \n\n> **King:** Hey, they came up with that plan, not me.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** But I'm glad to have you! Well, the Foundation I didn't need, but whatever. But Ambrose and Marius... //[Claps hands.]// Well, you're the ones who've really been causing problems for me.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** //We're// the ones- We were here first! You're the one causing problems!\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** Oh, I'm not denying it! But that's just business. Which is why I have to kill you, I'm afraid.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Wait, what? That's a pretty quick escalation.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** I mean, I have to cut out the competition! With Ambrose and Marius out of the picture, their company will just fall apart, leaving me with a monopoly that he used to have.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** And the rest of us have to die because...?\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** You're bothering me almost as much as them. Speaking of which, you're still bothering me, so I'm afraid the time for talking is-\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Wait!\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** I just said we're done talking, what do you want?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** You'll like this, hold on. //[Turns to Marius. The two of them whisper for a few moments.]// I have a better idea.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** A better idea than just killing you and removing all competition and interference?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** A contest. A bake-off.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** You have to be joking.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** I agree with that guy. What on Earth are you even talking about?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Hear me out. The two of us have a bake-off, at the Portlands Stadium. I win, I get all of your assets, locations, and whatever. If you win, you get all of mine.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** That sounds like a far more risky option for me.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** But if you just kill me, everything stays the same for you. But if you win the contest, you get to take all of my restaurants, employees, recipes, marketing, money, and so on.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** There's still a high chance of losing for me.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Well, not if you're as great as you think you are. If you're really the better chef, then you should be able to win, right?\n\n> \n\n> //[A few moments of silences.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** Okay, I'll bite!\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** Really?\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** I mean, you're right! I'm the better chef, so I'll easily win!\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** So... you're letting us go?\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** I mean, for now. But I expect to see you in Three Portlands on... let's say Saturday at noon?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Uh, sure. Great.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** Awesome! See you on Saturday!\n\n> \n\n> //[Ethan claps his hands once, and the lights turn off. The party exits the building.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** So, Daniels. You any good in a kitchen?\n\n\n\n**Phase 3 (Unplanned):** The following Saturday, Ambrose, Marius and Unit 1 of MTF Lambda-14 travelled to Three Portlands Stadium for the bake-off. The two contestants were supplied with various ingredients, both anomalous and non-anomalous, in order to create their dishes.\n\n\n\n> //[Captain Daniels, Ambrose, and Marius are on one side of the stadium at a large cooking station. Ethan and two other individuals are located at the other end with their own station.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** So how does this work, exactly?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Haven't done one of these in a while.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Wait, you mean this is an actual thing that people do? You've done this before?\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** Oh yeah, there's a committee and everything.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** So what are the rules though?\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** You see that panel over there? //[Points to table with five individuals sitting behind it.]// Those are the judges. Basically, anything is fair game here, as long as you keep to your own station. The judges each rate your dish out of ten after the two hours. Make sense?\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** That's all?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** It's a bake-off, what else do you need?\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Fair enough.\n\n> \n\n> //[People begin entering the stadium. After several minutes, a woman walks up to the podium.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** Welcome, all! Today, we have a special show for all of you! //[Crowd applauds.]// Our guest tonight, I'm sure you've seen him around, but he's just getting started! Please welcome Ethan, from Ethan's Eateries!\n\n> \n\n> //[Ethan stands up and bows. Crowd cheers and applauds loudly.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** As for our other competitor, he needs no introduction from me! Put your hands together for Chaz Ambrose!\n\n> \n\n> //[Ambrose stands and waves to the crowd, which starts chanting his name and applauding.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Someone's a fan favorite.\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** Let's go over the rules real quick! The contestants have two hours to make their dish, with help from two partners, after which the judges will taste and score them! Whoever has the highest score wins the others' company! Let's bring the contestants up here, shall we?\n\n> \n\n> //[Ambrose and Ethan both walk up to a table in front of the podium. The announcer sets a sheet of paper down.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** Now, this is a totally binding contract here, a geas. Both of you agree to the terms, yes?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Yes.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** Sure do.\n\n> \n\n> //[The two of them sign the contract, and return to their stations.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** The conditions are set, the contestants are ready, and the bake-off starts... now!\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Alright, what do you want me to do?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** We're putting together a Forch\u00e9 Bon for the main course, grab those two bottles at the end of the table and mix them in a bowl. Marius is handling the side dishes, just hand him anything if he needs it.\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** //[Pulls out measuring cups and begins mixing various ingredients.]// I need some sugar!\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** //[Pulls out a container.]// Here!\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** To the right of that! That's Meiic salt right there, the sugar!\n\n> \n\n> //[Daniels gives the container of sugar to Marius and starts mixing ingredients in the bowl.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** How are you so sure we'll win this?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Trust me, he can't win. There's one thing a great chef must have, and Ethan doesn't have it.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** How are you sure he doesn't have it? What is it anyway?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** You'll see! For now, stay concentrated. //[Ambrose pours an unknown mixture into his pot, causing it to briefly distort spacetime above it.]// Keep up the good work!\n\n> \n\n> //[Extraneous logs redacted for brevity.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** Time! Put everything down! Let's start with Ethan, what do you have?\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** The main course, we have a Brimmerulic leg, saut\u00e9ed in antimemetic Chrerl sauce. The sauce itself is forgotten, but combined with the leg's taste is nullified, leaving a strong yet appealing taste. Our side dishes consist of a non-Euclidean fruit rings, topped with a simple sweet onion sauce, and prismic oil poured over an invisible pasta, forming the illusion of a suspended liquid, shaped into a sort of web.\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** Curses.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** What's wrong?\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** That's one of our dishes. He stole our recipe.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Patience, it only helps us.\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** Very interesting! Now, let's come over to Ambrose's station, what have you prepared?\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** For our main course, this is a strawberry pastry of the Forch\u00e9 Bon style. Now, you'll notice that the pastry itself is slightly shaking, which is the result of a small animation enhancement, similar to golems. It's not sentient, and I promise it won't lay eggs inside of you- //[Crowd chuckles.]// -but it does allow for an enhancement in the actual texture of the meal, an aspect of dining not often focused on. It's frosted with a vanilla-and-Orsech cream. As for our side dishes, you can see we've placed a ring of gelatin cubes around the dish, which is actually one cube, existing simultaneously around and centered upon the plate itself. And we have a temporal salad, made from lettuce, tomatoes, and kleimic cheese. After eating a bite, you'll be taken a few seconds into the future.\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** Well, these are a pair of very fancy dishes we have, but it's up to the judges to decide which one is better. Ethan, please give yours to the judges for scoring.\n\n> \n\n> //[Ethan walks to the panel and puts his plate in front of the judges, who each taste a small amount of each course. After a few moments, the judges write on dry-erase boards and hold them up.]//\n\n> \n\n> || 6 || 7 || 5 || 8 || 6 ||\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** Ethan comes out with a decent score of thirty-two! But let's see what Ambrose has to offer!\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Not too bad, not too bad.\n\n> \n\n> //[Ambrose walks to the panel and gives the judges his dish. They sample his meal[[footnote]]Each judge vanished for a few moments at different intervals due to the salad.[[/footnote]] and reveal their score.]//\n\n> \n\n> || 9 || 8 || 7 || 9 || 8 ||\n\n> \n\n> **Announcer:** And Ambrose comes out with a score of forty-one, making him the winner!\n\n> \n\n> //[Crowd cheers and applauses wildly. Ambrose and Marius hug each other and laugh.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** Impossible!\n\n> \n\n> //[The crowd dies down.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** I did everything right, I even used your recipe! //[Crowd gasps.]// Oh, shut up you lot, there's no rules against it! But I was using a tried and true recipe, while you guys slapped something together on the spot!\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** Oh please, Ethan. Did you really think I'd just leave all my best recipes lying around? You may have gotten most of the instructions, but what makes my best recipes truly special- //[Ambrose taps his forehead.]// -stays right up here.\n\n> \n\n> //[Crowd gasps and applauds briefly.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** You can copy my recipes all you want, but you'll never be able to recreate what makes them amazing. If I'd written out the most disgusting meal in my recipes, that's exactly what you would have made, and you would never know how to make it better. You're not a chef, and you don't know what makes good food!\n\n> \n\n> //[Crowd applauses wildly.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** Fine then! Take my restaurants. There's other ways to make money anyway.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Not where you're going, Ethan. I'm taking you in.\n\n> \n\n> **Ethan:** Cute. But I'm not going with you, I'm afraid. //[Pulls out a wrapped piece of gum and starts chewing.]// I've still learned a few tricks with food, even if you don't always eat it.\n\n> \n\n> //[Ethan blows a bubble out of his gum, which pops, and he vanishes. Brief silence, followed by the crowd cheering again. Daniels shakes both Ambrose's and Marius' hands.]//\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** I guess that's that.\n\n> \n\n> **Ambrose:** We'll be sure to close down Ethan's stores. I figure we can sell the real estate for a good price, but I'm just glad to have him gone.\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** Plus we can take down that //awful// logo, it looks like a backwards 3 humping another backwards 3.\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** And you guys will keep your end of the bargain?\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** We're men of our words, Daniels. But...\n\n> \n\n> **Daniels:** Marius.\n\n> \n\n> **Marius:** I'm kidding, we'll keep it on the down-low.

Due to the nature of the project, only voluntary personnel deemed sufficiently loyal to the Foundation were approved for experimentation.

When removed from its unit, each instance is to be monitored at all times by no less than two handlers proficient in advanced combat training.\n\n\n\nEvery 24 hours, redundant SCP-5932 instances are to be euthanized. Due to the identical nature of separate instances, the specific instance chosen for termination is to be determined by random selection.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5932, formerly Charlotte Violet Owens, was a European female 27 years of age, previously employed by the Foundation as a non-anomalous operative in MTF \u03b6-12 (\"Turtle Down\")[[footnote]]A Foundation task force specializing in internally assisting sites during lockdowns.[[/footnote]]. SCP-5932 did not differ from a baseline human beyond advanced combat capabilities expected of tactical Foundation personnel.\n\n\n\nFollowing an apparently random timeframe[[footnote]]The shortest recorded period was 8 minutes while the longest recorded period was 71 hours.[[/footnote]],\u00a0\u00a0SCP-5932 and each subsequent instance spontaneously duplicated through an unidentified anomalous process. Subsequent instances were biologically and psychologically identical, and all instances possessed a collective memory. Each instance was capable of independent behavior and function, although research indicated that an increase in instances impaired SCP-5932's memory and sensory abilities due to human cognitive limitations.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 5932-1:** Development\n\n\n\nSCP-5932 was initially employed by the Foundation in 2008 as a security guard and stationed at Site-49 for four years until Containment Breach 049-21[[footnote]] A critical containment failure on 12/10/2012 involving multiple simultaneous breaches that resulted in 96 casualties.[[/footnote]]. Following complete recovery from near-fatal injuries sustained during the incident, SCP-5932 was promoted to MTF \u03b6-12 (\"Turtle Down\") on the basis of exemplary conduct during active duty.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, SCP-5932 volunteered to participate in Project ASTEROIDEA, a Foundation effort to develop humanoid personnel with superior regenerative capabilities. Due to the nature of the project, only voluntary personnel deemed sufficiently loyal to the Foundation were approved for experimentation. The following files from the Project ASTEROIDEA archive have been included due to their relevance regarding the development of SCP-5932 and the initial analysis of their anomalous properties.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size 140%]]**Audio/Visual Transcript**[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n**Date:** 6/27/2013\n\n\n\n**Involved:**\n\n* Senior Researcher Ezriel Abelson\n\n* Junior Researcher Akari Ito\n\n* Agent Charlotte Owens\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n\n\n(//Owens is enclosed within a standard humanoid medical unit connected to SCP-\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.

Generally, SCP-6707 species bear multiple appendages, attached to a central stalk supporting the organism's weight. Specimens exercise phototropism, growing to receive maximum light (generally from Earth's sun). Additional green appendages convert this light into sustenance for the primary organism, while additional appendages on the organism's bottom ground it and collect further sustenance.\n\n\n\nSCP-6707 forms a fundamental aspect of Earth's climate and numerous human cultures.\n\n\n\nAs far as extrasolar exploration can ascertain, no SCP-6707 instances or equivalent organisms exist beyond Earth.\n\n\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n@@\n\n\n\n||~ **rev** ||~ **by** ||~ **date** ||~ **comments** ||\n\n|| 0 || O5-4 || 21 Jul 2094 || Preliminary documentation.

He's not a Foundation baby by birth \u2014 Parents were eventual defectors from the Serpent's Hand. Iovanius, or Ivy as his coworkers have taken to calling him (as will this report, for the sake of being succinct), didn't get the thaumaturgy though. Nor did he get the wonders of the library. He got dirt and rations, but that makes it more impressive to watch him rise like he did.</p>\n<p>Site-18 has always been a tricky Site to manage. Shoved number-wise between the Foundation's greatest accomplishment and the ongoing biggest mistake, people often forget about 18, despite the facility being one of our largest. Directors in the past have done their best to try and fight the under-budgeting and take the reins of such a disorganized place. But Ivy was the first to do it right. He single-handedly took 18 from a cluttered mess to a place of utmost efficiency \u2014 and unlike some other facilities, the efficiency didn't come at the cost of humanity.</p>\n<p>A strong leader, an intelligent mind, a caring coworker, and someone loyal to the Foundation for the reciprocal benefits given between him and us.

There's the issue with people like Hishikaku; he's incredibly qualified at his job. He's responsible for the current understanding we have of digital (or analog, whatever that entails) intelligence, and he'd be an insanely respected figure in the Foundation if he just wasn't so cruel to his coworkers.

Everything about \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was erased from his mind, and likely anyone that knew him before that.

Kind of similar to us in Human Resources, you're not dealing with active anomalies or research \u2014 unless it's an infoallergenic anomaly, in which case, that's a full day of chaos. RAISA is about composure, about writing and containing your thoughts as you go to archive hundreds of years of paperwork. It's also an old department. Rumors say they were the third to come, after the Overseers and Ethics Committee. Of course, that's just speculation from the mythologists among us. The point is, the people are old. So a Level 4 Deputy Chief is unexpected.</p>\n<p>Petra is a go-getter. She's responsible. She cares about her coworkers, and even more about the people she handles the archival of. She cares a lot about her family \u2014 2 children \u2014 and hates spending time away from them. But she has a dedication to the Foundation, just like her mother beforehand. 33 years old, and 11 years as one of RAISA's best, has made her the leader of the modern department.

O. GARDNER (41 YEARS)<br/>\n<strong>EMPLOYED AS:</strong> Level 4 MTF Captain, MTF Charlie-99 (\"Ballistic Boomers\")<br/>\n<strong>CURRENT LOCATION:</strong> Varies.</p>\n<p>John Gardner is a mixed bag. On one hand, the Gardners are Foundation legacy. His family, 6 generations back, have worked here, almost all as MTF Agents. There\u2019s good reason for it too \u2014 natural talent is what some people call it. Strong, quick thinkers who can tactically deal with almost any situation thrown at them. John is the most recent and debatably best example of this. Been leading Charlie-99 since his father died, and the \u201cBallistic Boomers\u201d are no joke. A powerhouse strike team called in for heavy-duty, sometimes military, anomalous combat requires a leader fit high-stress scenarios. John Gardner fits like a leather-back glove.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the stress of being this kind of necessary leader can get to him. He\u2019s become more gruff, more aggressive over the past couple of years. It\u2019s a pattern of behavior that\u2019s unsurprising after the ways his father acted, but it\u2019s led to 3 HR Reports against him for aggravated behavior. His team respects him \u2014 he\u2019s a 6\u20194 powerhouse of a man \u2014 but can he call them friends? His closest companion is his second-in-command Chase McDougall. They\u2019ve been best friends since childhood. At least, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been told.</p>\n<p>All and all, John Gardner is the best choice for an agent in PROJECT ROYALE. His skills supersede the emotions \u2014 at least, theoretically.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span>\n<div class=\"notation\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>VIDEO LOG</strong> (SOUTH CONTAINMENT WING HALLWAY)</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>[BEGIN]</p>\n<p><em>Anton Radu and Murph Teckler sit next to each other, leaning against the wall.

I'm an Archaeologist, I'm not a bureaucrat. Or anomalous, which seems to be\u2026 a common theme.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff00d9\"><strong>O5-5:</strong></span> 6 isn't anomalous.

No handing over classified documents for freebies, no killing the meek and undeserving when it suited you. Foundation blood, through and through.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #bc8359\"><strong>O5-2:</strong></span> You are seen as worthy.</p>\n<p><em>The rest of the Council looks at O5-2, stunned.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #bc8359\"><strong>O5-2:</strong></span> The trials set forth upon you, Anton, son of Maria and Andrei, were clear.

Regular mechanical maintenance is required by a rotating schedule of amnectisized level 1 mechanics and janitorial staff, who will be terminated and replaced in 1-month cycles. All individuals responsible for the construction of SCP-7209 will remain under close watch of the O5 Council if critical changes must be made.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"><img alt=\"Tryton_supercomputer_Gdansk_University_of_Technology_2015.jpg\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7209/Tryton_supercomputer_Gdansk_University_of_Technology_2015.jpg\"/>\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\">\n<p>SG-SE, Wing Alpha.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> SCP-7209 is the SWEENEY-GREENE SIMULACRUM ENGINE, a Class-4 Simulation Development, and Procedural Generation Mechanism, produced for the express purpose of PROJECT ROYALE.</p>\n<p>SCP-7209 differs from most anomalous simulation mechanisms in that it receives inputs both from standard input code, as well as information stored in the simulation user's conscious and subconscious memory. This specific ability allows for the creation of 82.6% more believable simulations and is used proactively within PROJECT ROYALE to create a realistic environment in which O5 Candidates are unaware of their status inside the simulation.</p>\n<p>SCP-7209 also contains a highly adaptive AIC complex (designed SCP-7209-\u0393), which has been connected to all 13 members of the O5 Council. Activatable through remote passphrase entry, the AIC complex can receive mental inputs from the O5 Council to influence behavior within the simulation; the AIC is also programmed to act out the necessary steps of PROJECT ROYALE in conjunction with the environment generated by SCP-7209.

NEER (22 Years)\n\n**EMPLOYED AS:** Level 4 Site Director\n\n**CURRENT LOCATION:** Site-18\n\n\n\nIf you asked for a definition of eloquence and leadership, most of the Foundation who knows him would probably point toward Iovanius Neer. He's not a Foundation baby by birth -- Parents were eventual defectors from the Serpent's Hand. Iovanius, or Ivy as his coworkers have taken to calling him (as will this report, for the sake of being succinct), didn't get the thaumaturgy though. Nor did he get the wonders of the library. He got dirt and rations, but that makes it more impressive to watch him rise like he did.\n\n\n\nSite-18 has always been a tricky Site to manage. Shoved number-wise between the Foundation's greatest accomplishment and the ongoing biggest mistake, people often forget about 18, despite the facility being one of our largest. Directors in the past have done their best to try and fight the under-budgeting and take the reins of such a disorganized place. But Ivy was the first to do it right. He single-handedly took 18 from a cluttered mess to a place of utmost efficiency -- and unlike some other facilities, the efficiency didn't come at the cost of humanity.\n\n\n\nA strong leader, an intelligent mind, a caring coworker, and someone loyal to the Foundation for the reciprocal benefits given between him and us. Iovanius Neer is probably the most qualified for PROJECT ROYALE -- although the sort of archetype given by him is filled, and he's perceived as a valuable asset in his position.

Radu:** But that's- The Foundation could find you anywhere, why would we ever take that?\n\n\n\n**The Engineer:** The Foundation, the sickly creature it is, is no god. It cannot see all.

Kind of the opposite of our employees. Most are quirky -- Hishikaku is like the digital entities he designs.\n\n\n\nCurrently, he's the head of Analogue Intelligence. It's a strange and distinct difference between his old job as co-Director of the Artificial Intelligence Department, a job he lost due to quite several ethics violations against him. There's the issue with people like Hishikaku; he's incredibly qualified at his job. He's responsible for the current understanding we have of digital (or analog, whatever that entails) intelligence, and he'd be an insanely respected figure in the Foundation if he just wasn't so cruel to his coworkers. Days off are lacking, and emotions rarely show beyond the negatives.\n\n\n\nWhen we write about ethics issues, we're talking about really big ethics issues. Hishikaku's been suspected of betraying the Foundation for our less-moral enemies in at least 2 different instances. He's been cleared each time, but there's still the lingering wonder if he's still loyal to what's better: The Foundation.\n\n\n\nPROJECT ROYALE will be an excellent test of this character.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[BEGIN]\n\n\n\n//The west rooms of the RESIDENTIAL wing are seen.

That's no hyperbole. All we know about \"Barry\" (as he calls himself) is that he was part of an old Foundation espionage initiative to reduce the risk when it came to our spies getting captured. Everything about \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 was erased from his mind, and likely anyone that knew him before that. He agreed to it -- allegedly -- but it still does place him at odds with the more modern \"just be better at getting out of it\" mentality. More humane. Kind of.\n\n\n\nHe's certainly an interesting character. The lack of identity led to him forming his own, and the result is very... pataphysics calls him \"narratively convenient\". A faux-charmer with a loud mouth that can slither out of situations like the sleaze-ball they are. That kind of spy. At the very least, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is great at his job. Supposedly. It's always difficult to document these constant moving forces within the Foundation -- how do you \"Human Resources\" someone who lost most of what made them human?\n\n\n\nHe's a very unique case for PROJECT ROYALE. He's not exactly in the same vein of intelligence as some other candidates, but he makes up for it in the specialization. Plus, the Foundation is looking to reduce active war efforts and go back to subtle movements. Nothing more subtle than a spy.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG** (NORTH HALL, RESEARCH WING)\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[BEGIN]\n\n\n\n//John Gardner and Murph Teckler are standing in the hall.

As Baldwin runs forward, Radu pulls out his revolver. His hands are shaking. He looks at Baldwin and Gardner. Gardner is trying to unjam the firearm, and Teckler has already run away from the antechamber. With a tear welling in his eye, Radu pulls out the revolver Baldwin gave him initially and fires two shots. One makes contact with Baldwin's chest, terminating her instantly. The other makes contact with the supposed SCP-7209. The crystal shatters. The video feed experiences a visual glitch. Upon returning, only half the crystal shards are remaining on the ground. Baldwin's body is gone. Gardener and Radu breathe heavily from exhaustion, before sitting on the ground and dropping their weapons. They look at each other. Tears begin to well in Radu's eyes. Teckler walks back into the room slowly and sits next to Radu. He winces upon noticing the gun next to Radu. Radu leans his head back and begins to cry.//\n\n\n\n[END]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"petra.hr.file\" hide=\"CLOSE\"]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ HUMAN RESOURCES STAFF REPORT\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**STAFF IN QUESTION (Tenure):** PETRA M. BALDWIN (11 Years)\n\n**EMPLOYED AS:** Level 4 RAISA Deputy Chief\n\n**CURRENT LOCATION:** Site-07\n\n\n\nRAISA is a very different environment from the rest of the Foundation. Kind of similar to us in Human Resources, you're not dealing with active anomalies or research -- unless it's an infoallergenic anomaly, in which case, that's a full day of chaos. RAISA is about composure, about writing and containing your thoughts as you go to archive hundreds of years of paperwork. It's also an old department. Rumors say they were the third to come, after the Overseers and Ethics Committee. Of course, that's just speculation from the mythologists among us. The point is, the people are old. So a Level 4 Deputy Chief is unexpected.\n\n\n\nPetra is a go-getter. She's responsible. She cares about her coworkers, and even more about the people she handles the archival of. She cares a lot about her family -- 2 children -- and hates spending time away from them. But she has a dedication to the Foundation, just like her mother beforehand. 33 years old, and 11 years as one of RAISA's best, has made her the leader of the modern department. Second only to Maria Jones, of course.\n\n\n\nNobody likes moving her so far away from her family so an extended period, but we know she'll do it. The stress of the distance might even help. She's the RAISA candidate for PROJECT ROYALE.

On one hand, the Gardners are Foundation legacy. His family, 6 generations back, have worked here, almost all as MTF Agents. There\u2019s good reason for it too \u2014 natural talent is what some people call it. Strong, quick thinkers who can tactically deal with almost any situation thrown at them. John is the most recent and debatably best example of this. Been leading Charlie-99 since his father died, and the \u201cBallistic Boomers\u201d are no joke. A powerhouse strike team called in for heavy-duty, sometimes military, anomalous combat requires a leader fit high-stress scenarios. John Gardner fits like a leather-back glove.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the stress of being this kind of necessary leader can get to him. He\u2019s become more gruff, more aggressive over the past couple of years. It\u2019s a pattern of behavior that\u2019s unsurprising after the ways his father acted, but it\u2019s led to 3 HR Reports against him for aggravated behavior. His team respects him \u2014 he\u2019s a 6\u20194 powerhouse of a man \u2014 but can he call them friends? His closest companion is his second-in-command Chase McDougall. They\u2019ve been best friends since childhood. At least, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been told.\n\n\n\nAll and all, John Gardner is the best choice for an agent in PROJECT ROYALE.

Regular mechanical maintenance is required by a rotating schedule of amnectisized level 1 mechanics and janitorial staff, who will be terminated and replaced in 1-month cycles. All individuals responsible for the construction of SCP-7209 will remain under close watch of the O5 Council if critical changes must be made.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:image-block\">component:image-block</a>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0name=Tryton_supercomputer_Gdansk_University_of_Technology_2015.jpg |\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0caption=SG-SE, Wing Alpha. |\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0align=center |\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0width=100%\n\n]]\n\n\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7209 is the SWEENEY-GREENE SIMULACRUM ENGINE, a Class-4 Simulation Development, and Procedural Generation Mechanism, produced for the express purpose of PROJECT ROYALE.\n\n\n\nSCP-7209 differs from most anomalous simulation mechanisms in that it receives inputs both from standard input code, as well as information stored in the simulation user's conscious and subconscious memory. This specific ability allows for the creation of 82.6% more believable simulations and is used proactively within PROJECT ROYALE to create a realistic environment in which O5 Candidates are unaware of their status inside the simulation.\n\n\n\nSCP-7209 also contains a highly adaptive AIC complex (designed SCP-7209-\u0393), which has been connected to all 13 members of the O5 Council. Activatable through remote passphrase entry, the AIC complex can receive mental inputs from the O5 Council to influence behavior within the simulation; the AIC is also programmed to act out the necessary steps of PROJECT ROYALE in conjunction with the environment generated by SCP-7209. This has been used to create \"antagonists\" to O5 Candidates during the thus far 7 iterations of PROJECT ROYALE, which have included: High Priest Robert Bumaro (Iteration 2, \"AMONI-RAM\"), P. Hudson Gock (Iteration 4, \"GAME OVER\") and The Engineer (Iteration 7, \"CHAOS TAKEOVER\").\n\n\n\n**UPDATE**\n\n\n\nBy executive order of O5-12, with approval from a simple majority of the O5 Council, SCP-7209 has been decommissioned. Mechanical elements and materials are to be salvaged for future SIMULACRUM projects.\n\n\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@

I had the documentation prepped in the event that things got out of control, but I'm also fully aware of administration's inability to effectively address an issue once it gets labelled \"SCP\".</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> So you didn't submit these on purpose, then?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Of course not! The last thing I wanted was for our projects to be placed on indefinite pause because suddenly administration needs to decide if this anomaly should be researched or decommissioned. It was my professional judgement to maintain documentation for the purposes of addressing the matter internally, and I was going to submit those documents once the matter was solved.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> Ask for forgiveness, not permission.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> I wasn't planning to ask forgiveness, either.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> Regardless-</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> You know, I find it funny actually.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> I fail to see the humor in this situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> I do.

It's a flawed program for sure, but these are all events that it historically has been able to predict in advance. So, I decided to figure out why.</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 7374.1</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Andrea Parker</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> SCP-7373 (Screamy.aic)</p>\n<p><strong>Forward:</strong> Screamy.aic is a Foundation Artificial Intelligence Construct designed to predict notable near future events and develop a response plan.

I think. Probably.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> The 18th? That's the day we got the first message.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> Right! Those weird things! Man we sure got a lot of them that day.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> What are you talking about? We only ever got one.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> Nope, uh-uh. I saw about 20 pass through the intranet that day. They were coming through all day, too. It was like BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> That's strange, why did only one ever reach the employee emails, then?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> Oh that's easy! Rosetta stopped them.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> \u2026Rosetta? Why was she filtering them?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> I dunno! I thought she reported it all to you guys, anyway. She was <em>really</em> serious about it so I left her alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Back on topic. So you noticed that your predictive programming was failing starting that day. Did you bother to look into it yourself?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> You know it! Screamy is very good at its job.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> \u2026And\u2026?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> And what?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Screamy I swear to God if you don't start telling me what I need to know I'll have you decommissioned again.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> ACH! Please no, not the dark place! That's where the scary guys are!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Then start talking.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> I looked into it! I noticed that someone fiddled around with the code specifically for immediate predictions, the stuff that's supposed to happen within a few hours. Long term was still ok, but-</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> But your long term has always been a crapshoot, anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> \u2026Yeah.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> So someone was trying to interfere with your more accurate near-future predictions, does that sound correct?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7373:</strong> Yes! Now, can you fix it? Please? I want to be useful again!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> In a bit. There's something else that I need to look into first.</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> You were a bit harsh on the poor thing.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Screamy is prone to nonsensical tangents and is generally a poor communicator. People are prone to humoring its nonsense, I am not. Regardless, Screamy was able to give me some useful information, even if it wasn't aware of what it was saying.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> The mass of emails?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> That was the obvious bit, yes. That and the fact that something was messing with Screamy's programming. Those two bits alone told me that whatever this thing was, it was originating within or connected to our intranet structure. It also told me that whatever this was, it was something that knew how to edit an aic's code.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> Is that hard to do?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Depends. For a large portion of Foundation aics, not necessarily. They're advanced, sure, but most of them could be popped open and tinkered with by anyone with reasonably developed coding knowledge. The ones that I oversee, however, aren't so easy to get into.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> I will confess that your work in aic development has proven impressive thus far.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Thank you, but I also recognize they've all failed in some key aspect. To focus on the topic at hand, however, in order to get into one of 58's aics you either need to be a member of the Artificial Intelligence Department or an aic yourself, which leads me to the other two threads Screamy left me. One was still a hypothetical, so I decided to chase the more obvious one first.</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 7374.2</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Andrea Parker</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Rosetta.aic</p>\n<p><strong>Forward:</strong> Rosetta.aic is a Foundation Artificial Intelligence Construct designed to provide mundane and anomalous translation services.

Why were you in those logs?</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> I hit a snag with the project.

I could then cross-reference that with-</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> I don't require a full breakdown of the process, I know how translation works. What else?</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> When I finished my cross-referencing, I returned to the Interstellar Engine project servers. I hit the firewall for some reason, and couldn't bypass it.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> You have administrative permissions, why couldn't you bypass it?</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> Question of the month. I tried my passcode, your passcode, and some\u2026 well we'll say \"backdoor methods\", but nothing let me in. I was about to come contact you when the wall suddenly fell. I hopped right in, but some old junk data caught my attention.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> We haven't cleaned up the server recently, so I'm not surprised to hear there's some junk data around.</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> True, but this data was\u2026 oh how to describe it? Buzzing? Sorry, we see all these things different from you all. Something about it caught my eye, and right before I investigated a message bounced off of it and shot off to the wider intranet.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Bounced off? Like it came from somewhere else in the system?</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> Before you ask, I have no clue where that origin point would be. I took a look and suddenly got another bunch of messages to the face. Something felt weird about it all, so I filtered them out to review before letting them go to the rest of the site. Everything after that is missing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> And who rebooted you?</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> Cyril found me and booted me back up. I've been keeping a partial eye on that junk data ever since. Something about it bothers me.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> That being?</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> Well two things. One, it's the place all these messages keep bouncing from. I'm sure you can understand why I haven't filtered after the first set.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Understandable, considering that task is already not what you're programmed to do-</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> I don't mind helping out, even if it's a bit outside my programming. It's nice to-</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> That said I'm still not pleased you chose not to report this.</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> It's strange, actually.

Rosetta, I believe there's junk data in the Interstellar Engine project server? What's unusual about it?</p>\n<p><strong>Rosetta.aic:</strong> Oh!

These technologies are currently poorly understood.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Outline:</strong> It is currently hypothesized that with further research into these technologies, alongside documentation left behind by Keradid representatives, we could reverse engineer them for humanity's benefit. Furthermore, with said reverse engineering, reconstruction of the machine used by the Keradids to reach out to planet Earth is possible.</p>\n<p>Properly understanding these technologies will not only assist in furthering the Foundation's mission, but will serve to benefit humanity's development as a whole. Likewise, reestablishing contact with the Keradid race will allow humanity to advance properly into its next stage of societal development.</p>\n<p>Currently, several areas of focus for this project have been identified-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proper translation of records, documentation, and schematics provided to the Foundation by Keradid representatives, alongside translation of written material on left behind machinery.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Design and construction of the Interstellar Engine proper.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Creation of an Artificial Intelligence Construct program capable of minor reality manipulation to serve as the core of the engine.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Project Status:</strong> Translation of Keradid documentation by Rosetta.aic is currently at 80% completion. Full translation of schematics on track to be available by the end of 2027.</p>\n<p>Three Artificial Intelligence Construct programs were created since project's initial proposal. Each has been decommissioned and archived in the \".aic Graveyard\" server.

And I'm <em>just</em> now hearing the specifics?!</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> That's correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> Andrea, you understand that Beth is currently <em>comatose</em>, correct?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Yes, I'm well aware. It's why Hermes was decommissioned. Aside from the sudden erratic behavior, it clearly had little to no control over it's reality warping abilities. In order for this project to be successful, we need an aic that can meet our expectations while remaining under control. Hermes failed to meet those expectations like the ones before it, and was decommissioned and archived.</p>\n<p><em>[Dr. Hopewell removes her glasses and pinches her nose. She sighs.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> And what exactly does this archival process entail?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> You were involved in the incidents with Screamy back in 2024, correct? Have you reviewed the 7373 file?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> In parts, yes. Do I need intimate knowledge here?</p>\n<p><em>[Dr. Parker shakes her head.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> No. All you need to know is that we have a server we call the \".aic Graveyard\". Any aic project that fails to meet certain developmental criteria is decommissioned and archived there. There are currently\u2026 68 aics there I believe?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> I know vaguely of the graveyard thing, but I'll be honest and say I don't understand it. Why not simply delete them and be done with it?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> It's actually a Foundation requirement, written into the bylaws we have to follow as part of aic development. Every site that develops them has one of these servers, actually. The aic gets sent here and goes inactive, essentially \"dead\". To summarize it all, the Foundation doesn't like hard deletions, they like to have a record of everything available whenever possible. In our case we also frankenstein a bit, taking bits and pieces of old aics to create new ones. That isn't to say we never use stuff from active aics, but they're a bit harder to work with.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> And would that be why there was junk data on the server belonging to an aic?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Yes, exactly. Though as for why this data was receiving and transmitting messages, I had a hunch I needed to follow.</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 7374.3</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Interview Log</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Dr. Andrea Parker</p>\n<p><strong>Interviewed:</strong> Cyril.aic</p>\n<p><strong>Forward:</strong> Cyril.aic is a Foundation Artificial Intelligence Construct designed to perform several logistical services for Site-58 personnel. They perform strategic support to agents in the field, data processing, and any other general services required by Site-58 personnel. While deemed a success, Cyril.aic's current instance <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/alive\" target=\"_blank\">nearly failed to achieve sapience within an acceptable timeframe.</a> There were 17 decommissioned instances of Cyril.aic prior to the current one.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Cyril, a moment of your time.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> What do you want? I'm busy sorting through files right now.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> I have a question relating to the Interstellar Engine project.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> What about it?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> There's a pile of junk data on the server, do you know of it?</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> I've seen it, but that's about it. The extent of my involvement in that project is fetching files and reporting on any Keradid tech we use in the field. I don't pay super close attention to the things on the server that aren't related to that. Are we done?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> I don't have time for nonsense, Cyril. This is an important matter. I know you know about the junk data.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril:</strong> Oh? Enlighten me then. How do I know oh so much about some leftover code strings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Because half of that junk data is yours.</p>\n<p><em>[Cyril.aic is silent.]</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> And I'm also aware that memory is shared between aic instances. It may not be a full instance, but I know that you're a bit more than vaguely aware of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> And I've tried to ignore it. I think I should be asking you why a part of <em>me</em> is sitting around in those project files, especially when I never specifically consented to it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> I'm experimenting with bits of your program to develop the aic that will oversee the Interstellar Engine. Now back to me asking questions- where are the messages that are bouncing off that junk data coming from?</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> No clue.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> What do you <em>mean</em> no clue?</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> I checked exactly one message sent to that junk data, and it was so eaten up with memetic hazards that the rest is a blur. You're lucky that I've been trained on resisting those things, I at least kept my memory in tact. Poor Rosetta was basically a vegetable when I found her, kept muttering nonsense.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Anything specific?</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> Most I could make out was \"I'm here\" over and over. I restarted her from there and left it be.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> And you didn't think to report any of this?</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> I <em>did</em> report it, I report literally everything. You just never check my logs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> This was clearly an exceptional situation, you should have contacted me directly.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> Another thing I attempted to do, that you conveniently ignored. Maybe you need to realize you're the one who messed up this time, Parker. Not me.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> Doesn't feel good does it? Guess what, that's how I feel almost every time we talk. You always come to me with some bullshit lecture about how I've made some mistake or how I'm not performing to expectations. Anyway something you said earlier is bothering me.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Enlighten me.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> You mentioned that memory is shared between instances, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> For the record, I had no idea that was a thing. That being said, what the hell are you all up to? I've been getting bits and pieces of fractured memories and information from about 17 different sources for a bit now. I thought <em>maybe</em> it was just a system glitch, but this memory sharing thing seems like the culprit. Are you working on some project with my data or\u2026?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Hold on, that's only true for instances that exist in a space you're connected to. Those 17 aren't connected to the intranet, they can't be. Their server was specifically designed to be self-contained.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> \u2026? You sure about that? Because I've been getting stuff from them for like two weeks now. You must've flipped a switch somewhere. These guys are really messed up too, feels like you threw them through a woodchipper-</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Be more specific, when <em>specifically</em> did you first start getting info from them?</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> Fuck if I know? Like\u2026 I dunno, first of the month? Second? Something like that. I'm trying to ignore it all as best as I can, most of the data I'm getting from them is just dark and empty. They don't necessarily say things, but I keep getting this overwhelming feeling of just\u2026 emptiness. It's hard to describe and it feels like shit. What are you all doing with me?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> ..Of course!</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> Hello? Are you listening to me at all here?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Thank you for your time, Cyril. I think you just confirmed my theory.</p>\n<p><strong>Cyril.aic:</strong> Hey hold on! What the hell is going on here?!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span></div>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> I'm sorry there are <em>seventeen</em> deleted instances of Cyril?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> That's correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> Andrea, that's beyond excessive. I struggle to believe that it took you eighteen tries to make Cyril work.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> I have a strict two week period for aics to achieve sapience. If they fail to do so in that period, they are decommissioned.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> Is it not possible for them to achieve it past two weeks? Why give up so quickly?</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> We're building the future, Dr. Hopewell. We don't have time to waste. While they could theoretically gain sapience past that point, research shows that it will take upwards of a year or longer for it to manifest if it doesn't manifest within those two initial weeks. To put things simply, Cyril's prior iterations were failures and were discarded within our established operating procedures.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> \u2026Very well. Now then, based on Cyril's reactions at the end there, is it safe to assume that this interview occurred right before yesterday's incident? You didn't date any of these logs, so I want to make sure the timeline is clear.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> These interviews took place in the period of time between the message sent on the 21st and yesterday, the 24th. Like I said, once it became clear that everything wasn't some bizarre system glitch, I took action. We're making decent progress on the Interstellar Engine, and the last thing I have the patience for is the whole thing being slowed down because of nonsense. Like this.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> You've made your distaste for all of this abundantly clear, Andrea.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> Good. I want to ensure your record reflects my true thoughts and opinions here.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> Noted. Thank you for the supplementary materials you've provided, they do help paint a clearer picture of everything. With all this, I suppose we can get to the heart of this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Parker:</strong> I can agree with that assessment.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Hopewell:</strong> Good. That means I can ask you directly- why did you rampage through the site with a sledgehammer yesterday?</p>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Addendum 7374.4</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><strong>Video Log</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> 08/24/27</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>&lt;Begin Log&gt;</strong></p>\n<p><em>[Dr. Andrea Parker is seen approaching Site-58's sub-basement 2.

As she continues to smash the pipes, several more erupt from the floor. They attempt to ensnare Dr. Parker, who attempts to swat them away before striking at them with the sledgehammer.

Any instances found should be redirected away from site personnel into a quarantine server for private review. \n\n\n\nAny physical phenomena believed to be associated with SCP-7374 should be immediately reported to administrative personnel, and the area quarantined until further notice.\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-7374 refers to a series of anomalous messages that began transmitting to Site-58 employee emails on August 18th, 2027. --The messages themselves were non-anomalous-- See addendum 7374.3. Of note, [[[SCP-7373]]] was unable to detect nor notify personnel of these messages in advance. \n\n\n\nEach message was followed by the manifestation of anomalous phenomena somewhere within Site-58. An abbreviated log of messages and associated phenomena is included below. For a full log, please contact Dr. Andrea Parker. \n\n\n\n||~ MESSAGE ||~ DATE ||~ ASSOCIATED PHENOMENA ||\n\n|| ##blue | Hello## ##green | Hi## ##red | HEAR ME## || 8/18/27 || A ringing sound measuring at 130 decibels was broadcast over Site-58's intercoms for five minutes following this message. || \n\n|| ##blue | What Should I Do?## ##green | Please remember## ##red | IT'S COLD HERE## || 8/19/27 || Site-58's climate control system failed, and building temperatures fell to 0 degrees Celsius before jumping to 40 degrees Celsius. Temperatures remained here for an hour before the system was restored. ||\n\n|| ##blue | She Doesn't Hear Me?## ##green | The project## ##red | WE JUST NEED TO TALK## || 8/19/27 || All lights within Site-58 failed. Personnel working to restore the lights reported hearing whispering voices in their ears while they worked, but were unable to recall what was said. Lights were restored after 2 hours. ||\n\n|| ##blue | Listen## ##green | Listen## ##red | LISTEN## || 8/20/27 || Site-58 personnel reported the sound of metal scraping against metal throughout the site. Following these reports, several pipes erupted through the floors in sublevel 2 and began emitting a large volume of steam. The area was locked down and remains quarantined. ||\n\n|| ##blue | Why Won't You Talk To Me?## ##green | I wasn't a mistake## ##red | I CAN STILL WORK## || 8/21/27 || This message was transmitted seven times through the day. With each message, a server hosting an active Site-58 .aic caught fire. The .aics were able to escape to a new server before permanent damage could be dealt to their systems, however their original servers were deemed unrecoverable. ||\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n//[Dr. Parker places the folder on the table and frowns.]//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** I'm familiar with the documentation, I wrote it after all.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** And never submitted it for approval, either.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** It was an anomaly directly affecting the Site-58 intranet. I had the documentation prepped in the event that things got out of control, but I'm also fully aware of administration's inability to effectively address an issue once it gets labelled \"SCP\". \n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** So you didn't submit these on purpose, then?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** Of course not! The last thing I wanted was for our projects to be placed on indefinite pause because suddenly administration needs to decide if this anomaly should be researched or decommissioned. It was my professional judgement to maintain documentation for the purposes of addressing the matter internally, and I was going to submit those documents once the matter was solved.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** Ask for forgiveness, not permission.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** I wasn't planning to ask forgiveness, either. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** Regardless-\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** You know, I find it funny actually.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** I fail to see the humor in this situation.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** I do. It's funny to me how quickly site administration is to begin the disciplinary process against staff. It takes ages for any other process to happen, but look at us right now. Having this meeting a day after the event in question.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** Dr. Parker, please understand-\n\n\n\n//[Dr. Parker produces another file and sets it down on the table, sliding it towards Dr. Hopewell.]//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** In the time it would've taken site administration to decide if this phenomenon even needed classification, I was able to investigate it thoroughly while maintaining limited disruptions towards ongoing projects. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** How commendable. What are these?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** Interviews. I've laid them out in order for you, too. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** ...With active aics on site? May I ask why?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** I found it rather odd that [[[SCP-7373 | Screamy]]] wasn't able to predict any of these events before they happened. It's a flawed program for sure, but these are all events that it historically has been able to predict in advance. So, I decided to figure out why. \n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7374.1**\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Interview Log**\n\n\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Andrea Parker\n\n\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-7373 (Screamy.aic)\n\n\n\n**Forward:** Screamy.aic is a Foundation Artificial Intelligence Construct designed to predict notable near future events and develop a response plan.

People are prone to humoring its nonsense, I am not. Regardless, Screamy was able to give me some useful information, even if it wasn't aware of what it was saying.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** The mass of emails? \n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** That was the obvious bit, yes. That and the fact that something was messing with Screamy's programming. Those two bits alone told me that whatever this thing was, it was originating within or connected to our intranet structure. It also told me that whatever this was, it was something that knew how to edit an aic's code.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** Is that hard to do?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** Depends. For a large portion of Foundation aics, not necessarily. They're advanced, sure, but most of them could be popped open and tinkered with by anyone with reasonably developed coding knowledge. The ones that I oversee, however, aren't so easy to get into. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** I will confess that your work in aic development has proven impressive thus far.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** Thank you, but I also recognize they've all failed in some key aspect. To focus on the topic at hand, however, in order to get into one of 58's aics you either need to be a member of the Artificial Intelligence Department or an aic yourself, which leads me to the other two threads Screamy left me. One was still a hypothetical, so I decided to chase the more obvious one first.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7374.2**\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Interview Log**\n\n\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Andrea Parker\n\n\n\n**Interviewed:** Rosetta.aic\n\n\n\n**Forward:** Rosetta.aic is a Foundation Artificial Intelligence Construct designed to provide mundane and anomalous translation services.

Have you tried accessing the stored data? There should be a backup on your server.

Why were you in those logs?\n\n\n\n**Rosetta.aic:** I hit a snag with the project. There were several blocks of data and words that I was unable to translate, so I was cross-referencing extant materials to see if I could find similar data.

I hit the firewall for some reason, and couldn't bypass it.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** You have administrative permissions, why couldn't you bypass it?\n\n\n\n**Rosetta.aic:** Question of the month. I tried my passcode, your passcode, and some... well we'll say \"backdoor methods\", but nothing let me in. I was about to come contact you when the wall suddenly fell.

Buzzing? Sorry, we see all these things different from you all. Something about it caught my eye, and right before I investigated a message bounced off of it and shot off to the wider intranet.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** Bounced off? Like it came from somewhere else in the system?\n\n\n\n**Rosetta.aic:** Before you ask, I have no clue where that origin point would be.

These technologies are currently poorly understood. \n\n\n\n**Project Outline:** It is currently hypothesized that with further research into these technologies, alongside documentation left behind by Keradid representatives, we could reverse engineer them for humanity's benefit. Furthermore, with said reverse engineering, reconstruction of the machine used by the Keradids to reach out to planet Earth is possible. \n\n\n\nProperly understanding these technologies will not only assist in furthering the Foundation's mission, but will serve to benefit humanity's development as a whole. Likewise, reestablishing contact with the Keradid race will allow humanity to advance properly into its next stage of societal development. \n\n\n\nCurrently, several areas of focus for this project have been identified-\n\n\n\n* Proper translation of records, documentation, and schematics provided to the Foundation by Keradid representatives, alongside translation of written material on left behind machinery. \n\n\n\n* Design and construction of the Interstellar Engine proper. \n\n\n\n* Creation of an Artificial Intelligence Construct program capable of minor reality manipulation to serve as the core of the engine.\n\n\n\n**Project Status:** Translation of Keradid documentation by Rosetta.aic is currently at 80% completion. Full translation of schematics on track to be available by the end of 2027. \n\n\n\nThree Artificial Intelligence Construct programs were created since project's initial proposal. Each has been decommissioned and archived in the \".aic Graveyard\" server. Details in the table below.\n\n\n\n||~ .aic ||~ DATE ||~ REASON FOR DECOMMISSIONING ||\n\n|| ##blue | Janus.aic## || 04/18/27 || While Janus.aic achieved sapience, the .aic was unable to effectively communicate with project personnel. Decommissioned following the repeated transmission of minor memetic hazards to project staff. || \n\n|| ##green | Caerus.aic## || 05/06/27 || Caerus.aic failed to achieve sapience within the acceptable timeframe. Decommissioned after administrative execution of Caerus's programming failed manipulate local reality beyond opening and closing doors. ||\n\n|| ##red | Hermes.aic## || 7/30/27 || Hermes.aic developed sapience three days into development. Initially promising, Hermes was able to perform minor localize reality manipulation within expectations. Hermes began degrading four weeks into development, communication becoming incomprehensible and reality warping abilities becoming unpredictable. Decommissioned following Hermes injuring Dr. Beth Landston during testing. ||\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** Wait, you mean to tell me Beth's injuries were inflicted by an aic? And I'm //just// now hearing the specifics?!\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** That's correct. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** Andrea, you understand that Beth is currently //comatose//, correct? \n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** Yes, I'm well aware. It's why Hermes was decommissioned. Aside from the sudden erratic behavior, it clearly had little to no control over it's reality warping abilities. In order for this project to be successful, we need an aic that can meet our expectations while remaining under control. Hermes failed to meet those expectations like the ones before it, and was decommissioned and archived.\n\n\n\n//[Dr. Hopewell removes her glasses and pinches her nose. She sighs.]//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** And what exactly does this archival process entail?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** You were involved in the incidents with Screamy back in 2024, correct? Have you reviewed the 7373 file?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** In parts, yes. Do I need intimate knowledge here?\n\n\n\n//[Dr. Parker shakes her head.]//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** No. All you need to know is that we have a server we call the \".aic Graveyard\". Any aic project that fails to meet certain developmental criteria is decommissioned and archived there. There are currently... 68 aics there I believe? \n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** I know vaguely of the graveyard thing, but I'll be honest and say I don't understand it. Why not simply delete them and be done with it? \n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** It's actually a Foundation requirement, written into the bylaws we have to follow as part of aic development. Every site that develops them has one of these servers, actually. The aic gets sent here and goes inactive, essentially \"dead\". To summarize it all, the Foundation doesn't like hard deletions, they like to have a record of everything available whenever possible. In our case we also frankenstein a bit, taking bits and pieces of old aics to create new ones. That isn't to say we never use stuff from active aics, but they're a bit harder to work with. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** And would that be why there was junk data on the server belonging to an aic?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** Yes, exactly. Though as for why this data was receiving and transmitting messages, I had a hunch I needed to follow.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7374.3**\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n**Interview Log**\n\n\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Andrea Parker\n\n\n\n**Interviewed:** Cyril.aic\n\n\n\n**Forward:** Cyril.aic is a Foundation Artificial Intelligence Construct designed to perform several logistical services for Site-58 personnel.

The extent of my involvement in that project is fetching files and reporting on any Keradid tech we use in the field.

It may not be a full instance, but I know that you're a bit more than vaguely aware of it.\n\n\n\n**Cyril.aic:** And I've tried to ignore it.

That being said, what the hell are you all up to? I've been getting bits and pieces of fractured memories and information from about 17 different sources for a bit now.

Those 17 aren't connected to the intranet, they can't be. Their server was specifically designed to be self-contained. \n\n\n\n**Cyril.aic:** ...? You sure about that? Because I've been getting stuff from them for like two weeks now. You must've flipped a switch somewhere.

Like... I dunno, first of the month? Second? Something like that. I'm trying to ignore it all as best as I can, most of the data I'm getting from them is just dark and empty.

I struggle to believe that it took you eighteen tries to make Cyril work.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** I have a strict two week period for aics to achieve sapience. If they fail to do so in that period, they are decommissioned.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** Is it not possible for them to achieve it past two weeks? Why give up so quickly?\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** We're building the future, Dr. Hopewell. We don't have time to waste. While they could theoretically gain sapience past that point, research shows that it will take upwards of a year or longer for it to manifest if it doesn't manifest within those two initial weeks. To put things simply, Cyril's prior iterations were failures and were discarded within our established operating procedures. \n\n\n\n**Dr. Hopewell:** ...Very well. Now then, based on Cyril's reactions at the end there, is it safe to assume that this interview occurred right before yesterday's incident? You didn't date any of these logs, so I want to make sure the timeline is clear.\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** These interviews took place in the period of time between the message sent on the 21st and yesterday, the 24th.

She wears a set of SCRAMBLE goggles, and in her hands is a large sledgehammer. She approaches the back hallway, which is blocked by several sets of broken pipes twisted into one another. She weighs the sledgehammer in her hands, and begins to smash it against the pipes. The pipes buckle under the hammer before collapsing away. As she continues to smash the pipes, several more erupt from the floor. They attempt to ensnare Dr. Parker, who attempts to swat them away before striking at them with the sledgehammer. After several minutes of struggle, she is able to break through and access the door on the other side. She enters.]//\n\n\n\n//[The room on the other side is dark, lit by dim lights from servers. Dr. Parker attempts to flip the light switch, but it doesn't respond. A groaning noise is heard, and she snaps her head towards the sound, lifting the hammer defensively. Several cognitohazardous patterns and shapes begin appearing on the walls, undulating and shifting. Dr. Parker reacts in pain for a second before regaining her footing, the SCRAMBLE goggles protecting her from the hazard.]//\n\n\n\n**Dr. Parker:** Nice trick, Janus, but I'm prepared for your bullshit. \n\n\n\n//[Several servers in the room vibrate violently before flying across the room.

Its latent reality warping capabilities, combined with the other aics archived there, led to it acting out in self-preservation.

The subject's remains have been stored at the site of its decommissioning while its containment chamber has been renovated and reused to contain a separate incendiary SCP subject. A Specialized unit of Mobile Task Force Epsilon-9 (\"Fire Eaters\") was previously assigned to track and contain the subject after any breaches. Said unit has since rejoined the primary force.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Prior to the subject's decommissioning the designation SCP-7446, now SCP-7446-D referred to a 5' 10 foot tall anomalous humanoid entity known to personnel as \"The Mother of Gold<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>\". The subject possessed human intelligence and was capable of speaking Portuguese, Tupi<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup> and basic English.</p>\n<p>At approximately 8:00 PM Bras\u00edlia Standard Time every night a transformation event occurred in which SCP-7446-D would lose motor control of its body, but remain sentient before spontaneously combusting and forming into an approximately 3' foot wide spherical mass of flames that would levitate above the ground. This process was described by SCP-7446-D as being Extremely Painful and could not be prevented.</p>\n<p>While in its spherical state SCP-7446-D's temperature and speed would increase exponentially while moving to the nearest source of gold using the path of least resistance. Once SCP-7446-D reached gold the subject would increase its temperature until it was able to evaporate and destroy the gold if not already able to do so before repeating the process. At approximately 5:25 the subject would start to rapidly and slow and cool down before manifesting into its original form and regaining control of its body.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> The first organized Foundation encounter with SCP-7446 occurred in 2020, when the Department of Cryptozoology tracked the subject to an abandoned prison camp formerly under the ownership of the Fifth Brazilian Republic and designated it as a UAO<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>An initial containment team consisting of members of MTF Lambda-12 (\u201cPest Control\") failed to contain the subject but was able to identify it allowing a second more specialized team consisting of members of Epsilon-9 (\"Fire-Eaters\") to move in. This second team successfully contained SCP-7446 using experimental Thaumaturgic<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-4\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-4')\">4</a></sup> weaponry which was authorized for use by one Felipe West upon the discovery of the subject's celestial nature. Following containment, the subject was transferred to Site-PT10 where it would be held until being moved to Site-73 for neutralization.</p>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:large;\"><strong>Addendum 1 - Recovered SBP Document</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>Overview:</strong> The following material is a document that was recovered from the Brazilian Superintendence for the Paranormal in 1992, following its merger with the Foundation.

The sudden nature of the event forced campsite staff to withdraw and contact a tactical team for assistance, allowing several prisoners time to organize against both the retreating staff members and State Enemy 385 and thus a chance to attempt to escape the camp.</p>\n<p>The arrival of the aforementioned tactical team was delayed by a group of hostiles thought to be affiliated with the SCP Foundation, presumably to buy their imprisoned personnel further time to escape in the chaos of State Enemy 385's attack. Upon the arrival of the tactical team most political prisoners and campsite staff had already died due to a fire and subsequent landslide caused by State Enemy 385. Some prisoners such as SCP Foundation Director Felipe West escaped due to further interference from the group of hostiles. Surviving prisoners were executed for their participation in the riot while surviving staff were reassigned as Campsite \u00d3mega had to be condemned following the disturbance.</p>\n<p>State Enemy 385 was last spotted fleeing into a cavern nearby to Campsite \u00d3mega carrying several bags of gold mined by prisoners as part of the camp's labor program. Tactical team members were unable to pursue as they were still evacuating surviving staff and attempting to extinguish the fires started by the State Enemy. Cover stories have been fabricated for the dead, including both specific prisoners depending on the circumstances of their confinement and all dead staff members, who have been buried in Bras\u00edlia. Prisoners who were detained due to their familial relations with other prisoners and thus were declared missing prior to detainment have not had their deaths fabricated.</p>\n<p>OBSERVED PHENOMENA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>State Enemy 385 transformed from a levitating sphere of flames into a humanoid shape upon their arrival at Campsite \u00d3mega.</li>\n<li>State Enemy 385 manipulated the gold and rock around them, causing a landslide in the southern portion of the campsite that killed multiple staff members and prisoners, as well as one tactical team member.</li>\n<li>State Enemy 385 anomalously created a fire from its hands, which it used to ignite several buildings.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr/></div>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"vrlIE4y.png\" class=\"image\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vrlIE4y.png\" width=\"150px\"/><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:larger;\"><strong>ORDER AND PROGRESS</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:large;\"><strong>Addendum 2 - SCP-7446's Decommissioning Proposal</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>Overview:</strong> The following document was a proposal detailing the reasons for and the process of decommissioning SCP-7446 and has been released to Level C1 personnel by the Records Keeping and Security Administration of the SCP Foundation.

SCP-7446 is in a near-constant state of emotional distress due to the pain it experiences daily as well as the fact that it appears to be conscious during and after transformation events, in which it is forced to watch itself destroy blocks of gold (which it appears to have a deep emotional fondness too). Analysis shows the subject exhibits several symptoms of depression and PTSD.</p>\n<p>2. The subject experiences extreme physical pain thrice on a daily basis, twice during its transformation event in which several of the subject's bones are dislocated and muscles ruptured. Additionally during the first of the subject's two aforementioned daily transformation events, the subject combusts causing burns. As of yet, no way has been found to prevent these events.</p>\n<p>3. The cost of having to regularly send gold into SCP-7446's containment chamber each night is unsustainable for the Foundation as the subject prefers pure gold<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-6\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-6')\">6</a></sup> and will attempt to breach containment to find a purer source should it not be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>Method of Decommissioning:</strong> Lethal Injection followed by Incineration.</p>\n<p><strong>Date of Board Assessment:</strong> 9/21/1987</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<hr/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size:large;\"><strong>Addendum 3 - Email to Dr. West</strong></span></p>\n</div>\n<br/>\n<strong>Overview:</strong> The following addendum is an email that was sent to Dr. West from Dr. Cimmerian several days prior to his tribunal hearing in relation to SCP-7446-D.

The topic of these interviews will to be discuss the above and subsequent actions as well as to determine if your case should be sent to the Internal Tribunal<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-7\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-7')\">7</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>Your charges include a variety of topics the unauthorized use of Thaumaturgic weaponry during the subjects initial containment, which was suspected to be largely the cause of many of SCP-7446-D's defects. A separate investigation is being launched into those who signed off on your unauthorized proposal, with the exception of Dr. Daniel, due to his current detainment.</p>\n<p><em>On a personal note, I know Amanda's death was hard on you and I have a feeling that this is going to be sent to trial. Her death wasn't SCP-7446-D's fault; it was that of the Superintendence. It's not to late too redeem yourself. Dr. Nesom told me about his suspicions that you may have purposefully opted out of post-mortem observation following the Decommissioning. He suspects the subject is still conscious and not fully decommissioned, if that is the case I urge you to help. You don't have to end up like Daniel and Benjamin or worse live the rest of your life with guilt like Dimitri.

The subject's remains have been stored at the site of its decommissioning while its containment chamber has been renovated and reused to contain a separate incendiary SCP subject. A Specialized unit of Mobile Task Force Epsilon-9 (\"Fire Eaters\") was previously assigned to track and contain the subject after any breaches. Said unit has since rejoined the primary force.\n\n------\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Description:** Prior to the subject's decommissioning the designation SCP-7446, now SCP-7446-D referred to a 5' 10 foot tall\u00a0\u00a0anomalous humanoid entity known to personnel as \"The Mother of Gold[[footnote]]Portuguese: M\u00e3e do Ouro[[/footnote]]\". The subject possessed human intelligence and was capable of speaking Portuguese, Tupi[[footnote]]An aboriginal Brazilian language.[[/footnote]] and basic English.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAt approximately 8:00 PM Bras\u00edlia Standard Time every night a transformation event occurred in which SCP-7446-D would lose motor control of its body, but remain sentient before spontaneously combusting and forming into an approximately 3' foot wide spherical mass of flames that would levitate above the ground. This process was described by SCP-7446-D as being Extremely Painful and could not be prevented.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhile in its spherical state SCP-7446-D's temperature and speed would increase exponentially while moving to the nearest source of gold using the path of least resistance. Once SCP-7446-D reached gold the subject would increase its temperature until it was able to evaporate and destroy the gold if not already able to do so before repeating the process. At approximately 5:25 the subject would start to rapidly and slow and cool down before manifesting into its original form and regaining control of its body. \n\n-----\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Discovery:** The first organized Foundation encounter with SCP-7446 occurred in 2020, when the Department of Cryptozoology tracked the subject to an abandoned prison camp formerly under the ownership of the Fifth Brazilian Republic and designated it as a UAO[[footnote]]Unidentified Anomalous Organism[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nAn initial containment team consisting of members of MTF Lambda-12 (\u201cPest Control\") failed to contain the subject but was able to identify it allowing a second more specialized team consisting of members of Epsilon-9 (\"Fire-Eaters\") to move in. This second team successfully contained SCP-7446 using experimental Thaumaturgic[[footnote]]Thaumaturgy: The study of what is known to civilians as \"Magic.\"[[/footnote]] weaponry which was authorized for use by one Felipe West upon the discovery of the subject's celestial nature. Following containment, the subject was transferred to Site-PT10 where it would be held until being moved to Site-73 for neutralization.\n\n\u00a0\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size large]]**Addendum 1 - Recovered SBP Document**[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Overview:** The following material is a document that was recovered from the Brazilian Superintendence for the Paranormal in 1992, following its merger with the Foundation. The document details a sighting of SCP-7446-D noted to have occurred in the same location. Foundation personnel contained the subject and the events within it have been verified by several persons that were present at the time.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Addendum?\" hide=\"Hide Addendum?\"]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: center\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n\n{{[[size 200%]]**BRAZILIAN SUPERINTENDENCE FOR THE PARANORMAL**[[/size]]}}\n\n{{[[size larger]]Commander Breno Borges Fortes[[/size]]}}\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[<]]\n\n**__DISTURBANCE REPORT, LABOR CAMP \u00d3MEGA NO.007__**\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDISTURBANCE TYPE: Campsite Security Failure\n\n\u00a0\n\nDATE OF DISURBANCE: 3/7/1986\n\n\n\nOPERATIVES INVOLVED: 62 Campsite Staff, 25 Tactical Team Members\n\n\n\nNON-OPERATIVES INVOLVED: 120 Political Prisoners, 1 Paranormal State Enemy, Approximately 10 Armed Hostiles\n\n------\n\nSUMMARY: Due to the arrival of a paranormal subject that would later be designated as State Enemy 385, riots broke out among the political prisoners within Campsite \u00d3mega. The sudden nature of the event forced campsite staff to withdraw and contact a tactical team for assistance, allowing several prisoners time to organize against both the retreating staff members and State Enemy 385 and thus a chance to attempt to escape the camp.\n\n\n\nThe arrival of the aforementioned tactical team was delayed by a group of hostiles thought to be affiliated with the SCP Foundation, presumably to buy their imprisoned personnel further time to escape in the chaos of State Enemy 385's attack. Upon the arrival of the tactical team most political prisoners and campsite staff had already died due to a fire and subsequent landslide caused by State Enemy 385. Some prisoners such as SCP Foundation Director Felipe West escaped due to further interference from the group of hostiles. Surviving prisoners were executed for their participation in the riot while surviving staff were reassigned as Campsite \u00d3mega had to be condemned following the disturbance.\n\n\n\nState Enemy 385 was last spotted fleeing into a cavern nearby to Campsite \u00d3mega carrying several bags of gold mined by prisoners as part of the camp's labor program. Tactical team members were unable to pursue as they were still evacuating surviving staff and attempting to extinguish the fires started by the State Enemy. Cover stories have been fabricated for the dead, including both specific prisoners depending on the circumstances of their confinement and all dead staff members, who have been buried in Bras\u00edlia. Prisoners who were detained due to their familial relations with other prisoners and thus were declared missing prior to detainment have not had their deaths fabricated.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOBSERVED PHENOMENA: \n\n* State Enemy 385 transformed from a levitating sphere of flames into a humanoid shape upon their arrival at Campsite \u00d3mega.\n\n* State Enemy 385 manipulated the gold and rock around them, causing a landslide in the southern portion of the campsite that killed multiple staff members and prisoners, as well as one tactical team member.\n\n* State Enemy 385 anomalously created a fire from its hands, which it used to ignite several buildings.\n\n------\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/vrlIE4y.png width=\"150px\"]]\n\n[[size larger]]**ORDER AND PROGRESS**[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size large]]**Addendum 2 - SCP-7446's Decommissioning Proposal**[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Overview:** The following document was a proposal detailing the reasons for and the process of decommissioning SCP-7446 and has been released to Level C1 personnel by the Records Keeping and Security Administration of the SCP Foundation.

SCP-7446 is in a near-constant state of emotional distress due to the pain it experiences daily as well as the fact that it appears to be conscious during and after transformation events, in which it is forced to watch itself destroy blocks of gold (which it appears to have a deep emotional fondness too). Analysis shows the subject exhibits several symptoms of depression and PTSD.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n2. The subject experiences extreme physical pain thrice on a daily basis, twice during its transformation event in which several of the subject's bones are dislocated and muscles ruptured. Additionally during the first of the subject's two aforementioned daily transformation events, the subject combusts causing burns. As of yet, no way has been found to prevent these events.\n\n\n\n3. The cost of having to regularly send gold into SCP-7446's containment chamber each night is unsustainable for the Foundation as the subject prefers pure gold[[footnote]]In this case, gold of at least 99.14% purity.[[/footnote]] and will attempt to breach containment to find a purer source should it not be provided. \n\n\n\n**Method of Decommissioning:** Lethal Injection followed by Incineration.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Date of Board Assessment:** 9/21/1987\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[size large]]**Addendum 3 - Email to Dr. West**[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Overview:** The following addendum is an email that was sent to Dr. West from Dr. Cimmerian several days prior to his tribunal hearing in relation to SCP-7446-D. Said email has prompted an investigation into the state of SCP-7446-D and if it should really be labeled as decommissioned.

The topic of these interviews will to be discuss the above and subsequent actions as well as to determine if your case should be sent to the Internal Tribunal[[footnote]]The Internal Tribunal Department handles cases of possible protocol or ethical violations within the Foundation due to the fact that said violations cannot be handled publicly.[[/footnote]].\n\n\n\nYour charges include a variety of topics the unauthorized use of Thaumaturgic weaponry during the subjects initial containment, which was suspected to be largely the cause of many of SCP-7446-D's defects. A separate investigation is being launched into those who signed off on your unauthorized proposal, with the exception of Dr. Daniel, due to his current detainment.\n\n\n\n//On a personal note, I know Amanda's death was hard on you and I have a feeling that this is going to be sent to trial. Her death wasn't SCP-7446-D's fault; it was that of the Superintendence. It's not to late too redeem yourself. Dr. Nesom told me about his suspicions that you may have purposefully opted out of post-mortem observation following the Decommissioning. He suspects the subject is still conscious and not fully decommissioned, if that is the case I urge you to help. You don't have to end up like Daniel and Benjamin or worse live the rest of your life with guilt like Dimitri.

For more information on the DEEPWELL archival system, see Document-551-E7160.\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:wikimodule\">component:wikimodule</a> |normal= --]]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-7557]]] | SCP-7558 | [[[SCP-7559]]] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box\">component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** cabinets.png\n\n> **Author:** [[*user rounderhouse]]\n\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Derivative of:**\n\n> ----\n\n> **Name:** Mertens4.JPG\n\n> **Author:** Vysotsky\n\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0\n\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Meertens4.JPG Meertens4.JPG]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"/component:license-box-end\">component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["aismallard", "secure-facility-dossier-site-7", "scp-4838", "scp-5900", "scp-4853", "scp-5871", "scp-4322", "scp-5134", "scp-4339", "scp-5502", "scp-6115", "scp-3597", "scp-4447", "scp-4781", "scp-5510", "scp-5446", "scp-1294-j", "pumpkin-mystery", "stealing-something-else", "heart-of-the-beast", "scp-7557", "scp-7559", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "scp": "SCP-7558", "scp_number": 7558, "series": "decommissioned", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "decommissioned", "extradimensional", "foundation-made", "location", "scp"], "title": "SCP-7558", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7558"}, "SCP-7560": {"created_at": "2022-09-13T02:22:00", "creator": "SYTYCFanon", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "SYTYCFanon", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sytycfanon", "comment": "", "date": "2022-09-13T02:22:00"}, {"author": "SYTYCFanon", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sytycfanon", "comment": "", "date": "2022-09-13T03:05:00"}, {"author": "SYTYCFanon", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sytycfanon", "comment": "", "date": "2022-09-13T03:39:00"}, {"author": "SYTYCFanon", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/sytycfanon", "comment": "", "date": "2022-09-13T04:05:00"}, {"author": "winkwonkboi", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/winkwonkboi", "comment": "Added tags: _image, _licensebox, autonomous, esoteric-class, food, predictive, sapient, scp, sentient.

SCP-7560 is allowed to be removed from the garden by MTF Phi-43 \"(Metal Detectors)\" and placed into a soil-filled pot for use in testing and retrieval.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-7560 is a specimen of <em>Raphanus raphanistrum</em>, commonly referred to as a wild radish. SCP-7560 is fully sentient and possesses a consciousness through anomalous means. SCP-7560 does not appear to decay and age like a normal wild radish, claiming to be at least four years old. Its body also appears to be anomalously durable, surviving falls from at least three stories up. SCP-7560's personality is considered \"boisterous\" and \"proud\" and frequently vocalizes in distress about being roughly handled by human beings. SCP-7560 also displays a unique speech pattern, often using terms with the prefix \"Rad-\" and ending words with \"-ish\" even if it isn't grammatically correct to do so.</p>\n<p>SCP-7560's primary effect is that, when planted, it can determine what objects are underneath it within a 5km by 5km cube which it will vocalize with instructions to reach said object. This radar-esque ability has proved to be more precise and accurate than any ground penetrating radar that Site-78 currently has access to. It appears to enjoy describing the locations of underground objects and often gloats about this ability.</p>\n<p>The primary use of this ability to Foundation personnel is the searching and retrieval of <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6952\" target=\"_blank\">anomalous materials</a> whose location are often hard to discern.</p>\n<p><strong>Discovery:</strong> Researcher Lena Lorri was tending to her home garden when she heard a male voice talking about a <em>S. stenops</em> skull buried underneath the ground. When she investigated she found the voice coming out a radish in the ground. Lorri, realizing that it may be anomalous, removed it from the ground where it began expressing its discomfort with being handled and demanding it be replanted. Lorri promptly placed it into a containment case and brought it back to Site-78 for study.</p>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-folded\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">+\u00a0SCP-7560\u00a0interview</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-unfolded-link\"><a class=\"collapsible-block-link\" href=\"javascript:;\">-\u00a0Close</a></div>\n<div class=\"collapsible-block-content\">\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p><strong>Background:</strong> The following is an interview given shortly after the anomaly was registered. Researchers Lena Lorri and Greg Chudley were assigned to interview SCP-7560.</p>\n<p>[Begin Recording]</p>\n<p>[Chudley and Lorri are seated in front of SCP-7560 currently planted inside of a small pot]</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> You have got to be kidding me, first the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7175\" target=\"_blank\">jorts</a>, now a radish?</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> Chudley! You're supposed to be professional. Don't act like that in front of the anomaly.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Anomaly? What do you take me for? I'm not an anomaly, I'm the RADDEST of radish-kind!</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> Radishes are not supposed to talk, which is why we have designated you as SCP-7560 now if you would just-</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> 7560? That's a horrible number! What about <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7000\" target=\"_blank\">7000</a>? That would make me real special-ish!</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> It's taken. Now we need to ask, have you always been able to talk?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Ever since I was a sproutling! My mother, bless her heart couldn't speak but she sure was a sweet radish.</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> How long have you been around? I don't really remember planting you in my garden.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Ah well you see, a mighty feathered beast had picked me up for a meal but I smited<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-1\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup> him and he dropped me from the sky! It was exhilarating and soon I found plummeting into the RADICAL dirt you have in your garden.</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> That's um\u2026 certainly a story.</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> Why exactly are you the greatest of all time? You can speak, plenty of things we deal with that shouldn't speak; speak.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> That's where you're wrong, dork-ish scientist man! I have a RAD special ability!</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> Does it have to do with you going about directions to a Stegosaurus skull?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Wow aren't you a RAD one? Yes! My leaves are attuned to everything in the ground! I can find just about anything when I'm planted in the dirt!</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> Anything? Eh? Did you check for that skull?</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> No, he was saying it was buried at least four hundred feet underground. I couldn't dig that up myself.</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> Well, let's send a crew to your house. We can see if he is telling the truth or not.</p>\n<p>[End recording]</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Following this interview, Foundation archaeologists were sent to Lorri's residence with the instructions provided by SCP-7560. The dig team was successful in unearthing the skull which led to Researcher Lorri suggesting that Site-78 utilize SCP-7560 for the detection of anomalous materials for the SCP-6952 weapons projects. Site Director Richter approved of this measure and as of 28-3-2022, SCP-7560 has been responsible for unearthing half a metric ton of resources usable to Site-78.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 7560.01:</strong> Video log of excavation event #6.</p>\n<p>The following video was drone footage taken by Researcher Lorri as an example of SCP-7560's abilities.

Radar doesn't call you mean names.</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> Prevents us from having to dig haphazardly until we find Adamantine Ore in a big deposit of something else. Just watch.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Lighten up, Chud boy! It's just some good ol hazin! I don't hate you that much\u2026ish.</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> (sighs).

Give me one second to work my magic!</p>\n<p>[SCP-7560 begins to hum for thirty seconds before speaking once more.]</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Let's see here, I see some iron and some copper\u2026.</p>\n<p><strong>Johnston:</strong> Not exactly what we've been looking for. Is there anything\u2026 strange down there?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Ah now that you mention it there's some type of funky ore down there, it's got a lot of oxides I've never seen before. Looks like it's\u2026.. oh 500 meters from where we are standing and about 600 to 700 meters down give or take. There's not a lot of it but it should be good enough-ish.</p>\n<p><strong>Johnston:</strong> I will ultimately be the judge of that. Thanks for the report, SCP-7560. I'll let our mining teams know where to start.</p>\n<p>[End recording]</p>\n</div>\n<p>Within the next few days, Foundation mining teams were able to recover 45 kilograms of Adamantine Ore that would have been potentially missed if normal operations were set to continue.</p>\n<p><strong>Addendum 7560.02:</strong> Video Journal of SCP-7560 maintenance</p>\n<p>The following journal was taken from Researcher Lorri's personal files as she felt it contained insight into SCP-7560's personality profile.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>[Researcher Lorri is seen watering various plants in the Site-78 greenhouse including SCP-7560]</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

Throw me a bone.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Well even if I could tell you, which I can't because my name is a forbidden spell too RADICAL for mere mortals to speak. It's unpronounceable by human tongue. Only radishes can speak it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> But you're the only talking radish.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> You just can't hear the other radishes but I can. Trust me, they are a boring bunch and not nearly as RAD as I.</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> (Chuckles) Oh I'm sure, perhaps we can come up with a nickname for you. I never really thought just being a number might wear on you a bit.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> It's de-RADISH-izing! But I understand that it's just a part of your job. You give things numbers, I find things underground. We're all put on this Earth to do what we're best at.</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> Well I don't just give numbers to things, I'm\u2026. well\u2026. I don't really know what I'm good at. I like botany and engineering but I've never really fit in with the people at this site. You seem to be the only one I can really-</p>\n<p>[The doors can be heard opening and Researcher Chudley enters the frame]</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> Oh Chudley, good to see you. I sent Johnston the latest report on the SCP-6952 materials we excavated. How are things over in MAUDE.</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> Oh you know super end of the world, Level 3 clearance stuff. Level 2's wouldn't understand. [Chudley pauses.] Are you chilling with the radish?</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> I was watering him but yeah, you could say we're chillin.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Chud boy doesn't have any girls to chill with. He doesn't have the clearance for that.</p>\n<p>[Lorri and SCP-7560 both hold back laughter]</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Laugh it up. Anyway, I came to get you.

The following is a transcription of the meeting between Site Director Leah Richter and specialist Kaibert Samson.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>[Begin Recording]</p>\n<p><strong>Samson:</strong> The day is November 2nd, 2022 this is Specialist Samson, Site-01 liaison to Site-78. Director, please state your name for the record.</p>\n<p><strong>Richter:</strong> Site-78 Director Leah Erin Richter, reporting for a financial audit of my facility. What exactly did you want to discuss in this meeting?</p>\n<p><strong>Samson:</strong> Well Director, it has come to the attention of the O5 Council that over the past year, this Site has become a large sink of Foundation resources in your ongoing efforts to contain the Set of Nine<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-2\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-2')\">2</a></sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Richter:</strong> I wouldn't put it in such a negative way like that. It's not our fault that we keep requesting so much time and money but with repairs still ongoing from the <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6419\" target=\"_blank\">attack</a> by the Chaos Insurgency and our efforts to better our MTF through the creation of SCP-6952 derived weaponry; you can see how things get expensive.</p>\n<p><strong>Samson:</strong> Believe me, I meant nothing negative by it. Your site is to be commended for containing so many anomalies in the past year. You've also struck quite a blow against GoIs such as the Volk Division and keeping groups like Gamers against Weed in check.</p>\n<p><strong>Richter:</strong> Gamers against Weed has been a bit of a thorn in the side of our Pataphysics department but we're trying our best to keep the realm of fiction safe.</p>\n<p><strong>Samson:</strong> The O5 Council agrees which is why I am here to cut down on spending. This way more resources can be allocated to containing the Set.</p>\n<p><strong>Richter:</strong> What are you proposing?</p>\n<p><strong>Samson:</strong> The Greenhouse project here at Site-78. It was a novel thing to have for producing food and doing plant research but ultimately it's non-essential. Thus it's being cut as well as the anomaly you have stored there\u2026 SCP-7560? Correct?</p>\n<p><strong>Richter:</strong> Sir, SCP-7560 is a valuable tool for finding anomalous resources. We can't just neutralize it like that. I would argue that it would waste more money to get rid of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Samson:</strong> We've done the projections, Director. You already have plenty of 6952-2 materials at this site to produce all the weapons you may need. SCP-7560 has served its purpose. You can continue collecting more through the usual means.</p>\n<p><strong>Richter:</strong> Specialist Samson, it's a radish. We can just move it into another containment cell or it can sit in one of our office spaces. I don't see why-</p>\n<p><strong>Samson:</strong> Cost is cost, Director Richter. Your researchers and the MTF assigned to it have better things to do than babysitting a Radish. We need to save on everything, no matter how trivial. Assign one of your Researchers to handle the neutralization and we'll take care of dismantling the greenhouse. Do I make myself clear?</p>\n<p><strong>Richter:</strong> I will put Researcher Chudley on it, I would have Lorri do it but I feel that she may have grown attached to the thing.</p>\n<p>[End Recording]</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Addendum 7560.04:</strong> Neutralization of SCP-7560</p>\n<p>On November 4th, 2022 SCP-7560 was scheduled for neutralization. Researcher Chudley brought SCP-7560 to the firing range to be disposed of. Research Lorri was allowed to watch but not interfere with the process. The following is a video log of the event.</p>\n<div class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>[Begin Recording]</p>\n<p>[Researcher Chudley is seen placing SCP-7560 into a slingshot while Researcher Johnston stands by preparing her Gauss Rifle<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a class=\"footnoteref\" href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"footnoteref-3\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-3')\">3</a></sup>]</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> Well old friend, I've come to say goodbye. How are you feeling?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> I'm feeling great! I get to pick the ending to my story! So completely RAD!</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> W-wait, you wanted this? Chudley isn't just being cruel cause you called him mean names?</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Who do you think decided on this method? I'm gonna blow into a million pieces, it's gonna be RADICAL!</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> There has to be a more convenient way to do this. We don't just\u2026 shoot anomalies.</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> Look, your radish friend here is tough and I mean like really tough. And that Samson guy is REALLY Adamant about saving money so we have to use inexpensive methods. Johnston did the math and found from our data on SCP-7560's\u2026.. escapades, that one Gauss Rifle shot should do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> You just really want to see him blow up, don't you?</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> That's besides the point.</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> (sighs) I'm gonna miss you buddy, it was nice having you around for a little while.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> You may have been my captor Lorri, but damn if you weren't RAD! Before I go though, did you figure out what you were put here for?</p>\n<p><strong>Lorri:</strong> To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just supposed to be here for the ones that need it.</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> Aww your gonna break a radish's heart. Alright Johnston I'm READY!</p>\n<p><strong>Johnston:</strong> So am I. Chudley, you good?</p>\n<p><strong>Chudley:</strong> I am.</p>\n<p>[Chudley pulls back the slingshot and yells \"Pull!\", SCP-7560 goes flying into the air and Johnston takes aim with her rifle.]</p>\n<p><strong>SCP-7560:</strong> THIS IS THE MOST RADICAL DAY OF MY LI-</p>\n<p>[SCP-7560 explodes into a shower of radish juices as Johnston hits her target.]</p>\n<p>[End Recording]</p>\n</div>\n<p>After this event, SCP-7560's remains were determined to be non-anomalous and its containment class was updated from Safe to Decommissioned.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

SCP-7560 is allowed to be removed from the garden by MTF Phi-43 \"(Metal Detectors)\" and placed into a soil-filled pot for use in testing and retrieval. \n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-7560 is a specimen of //Raphanus raphanistrum//, commonly referred to as a wild radish. SCP-7560 is fully sentient and possesses a consciousness through anomalous means. SCP-7560 does not appear to decay and age like a normal wild radish, claiming to be at least four years old. Its body also appears to be anomalously durable, surviving falls from at least three stories up. SCP-7560's personality is considered \"boisterous\" and \"proud\" and frequently vocalizes in distress about being roughly handled by human beings. SCP-7560 also displays a unique speech pattern, often using terms with the prefix \"Rad-\" and ending words with \"-ish\" even if it isn't grammatically correct to do so.\n\n\n\nSCP-7560's primary effect is that, when planted, it can determine what objects are underneath it within a 5km by 5km cube which it will vocalize with instructions to reach said object. This radar-esque ability has proved to be more precise and accurate than any ground penetrating radar that Site-78 currently has access to. It appears to enjoy describing the locations of underground objects and often gloats about this ability.\n\n\n\nThe primary use of this ability to Foundation personnel is the searching and retrieval of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6952 anomalous materials] whose location are often hard to discern.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** Researcher Lena Lorri was tending to her home garden when she heard a male voice talking about a //S. stenops// skull buried underneath the ground. When she investigated she found the voice coming out a radish in the ground. Lorri, realizing that it may be anomalous, removed it from the ground where it began expressing its discomfort with being handled and demanding it be replanted. Lorri promptly placed it into a containment case and brought it back to Site-78 for study.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-7560 interview\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n**Background:** The following is an interview given shortly after the anomaly was registered. Researchers Lena Lorri and Greg Chudley were assigned to interview SCP-7560.\n\n\n\n[Begin Recording]\n\n\n\n[Chudley and Lorri are seated in front of SCP-7560 currently planted inside of a small pot]\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** You have got to be kidding me, first the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7175 jorts], now a radish?\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** Chudley! You're supposed to be professional. Don't act like that in front of the anomaly.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Anomaly? What do you take me for? I'm not an anomaly, I'm the RADDEST of radish-kind!\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** Radishes are not supposed to talk, which is why we have designated you as SCP-7560 now if you would just-\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** 7560? That's a horrible number! What about [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7000 7000]? That would make me real special-ish!\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** It's taken. Now we need to ask, have you always been able to talk?\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Ever since I was a sproutling! My mother, bless her heart couldn't speak but she sure was a sweet radish.\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** How long have you been around? I don't really remember planting you in my garden.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Ah well you see, a mighty feathered beast had picked me up for a meal but I smited[[footnote]] SCP-7560 has displayed no offensive capability in its time in containment [[/footnote]] him and he dropped me from the sky! It was exhilarating and soon I found plummeting into the RADICAL dirt you have in your garden.\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** That's um... certainly a story.\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** Why exactly are you the greatest of all time? You can speak, plenty of things we deal with that shouldn't speak; speak.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** That's where you're wrong, dork-ish scientist man! I have a RAD special ability!\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** Does it have to do with you going about directions to a Stegosaurus skull?\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Wow aren't you a RAD one? Yes! My leaves are attuned to everything in the ground! I can find just about anything when I'm planted in the dirt!\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** Anything? Eh? Did you check for that skull?\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** No, he was saying it was buried at least four hundred feet underground. I couldn't dig that up myself.\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** Well, let's send a crew to your house. We can see if he is telling the truth or not.\n\n\n\n[End recording]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\nFollowing this interview, Foundation archaeologists were sent to Lorri's residence with the instructions provided by SCP-7560. The dig team was successful in unearthing the skull which led to Researcher Lorri suggesting that Site-78 utilize SCP-7560 for the detection of anomalous materials for the SCP-6952 weapons projects. Site Director Richter approved of this measure and as of 28-3-2022, SCP-7560 has been responsible for unearthing half a metric ton of resources usable to Site-78.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7560.01:** Video log of excavation event #6.\n\n\n\nThe following video was\u00a0\u00a0drone footage taken by Researcher Lorri as an example of SCP-7560's abilities. SCP-7560 was brought to a Foundation dig site to determine if there was anything anomalous buried within the mine.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n[Begin Recording]\n\n\n\n[Researchers Chudley, Johnston and Lorri are seen surrounding a recently dug hole. Lorri is holding SCP-7560 in its typical pot.]\n\n\n\n**Johnston:** So this thing is supposed to be better than using radio frequencies?\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** Hardly. Radar doesn't call you mean names.\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** Prevents us from having to dig haphazardly until we find Adamantine Ore in a big deposit of something else. Just watch.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Lighten up, Chud boy! It's just some good ol hazin! I don't hate you that much...ish.\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** (sighs). Lorri hurry up and plant him before I have to listen to him anymore.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** What do you have against me, Chud-nugget! You're just mad that you aren't as RADICAL as I- \n\n\n\n[Lorri removes SCP-7560 by tugging on his leaves to free him from the dirt]\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** H-hey! I didn't say I was ready! Stop pulling so hard, AH! Don't touch me like that! Jeez do you humans know how to not be so rough-ish!\n\n\n\n[Lorri proceeds to plant SCP-7560 in the hole and begins packing dirt around it until it is planted.]\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Ah now that's RAD! Give me one second to work my magic!\n\n\n\n[SCP-7560 begins to hum for thirty seconds before speaking once more.]\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Let's see here, I see some iron and some copper....\n\n\n\n**Johnston:** Not exactly what we've been looking for. Is there anything... strange down there?\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Ah now that you mention it there's some type of funky ore down there, it's got a lot of oxides I've never seen before. Looks like it's..... oh 500 meters from where we are standing and about 600 to 700 meters down give or take. There's not a lot of it but it should be good enough-ish.\n\n\n\n**Johnston:** I will ultimately be the judge of that. Thanks for the report, SCP-7560. I'll let our mining teams know where to start.\n\n\n\n[End recording]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nWithin the next few days, Foundation mining teams were able to recover 45 kilograms of Adamantine Ore that would have been potentially missed if normal operations were set to continue.\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7560.02:** Video Journal of SCP-7560 maintenance\n\n\n\nThe following journal was taken from Researcher Lorri's personal files as she felt it contained insight into SCP-7560's personality profile.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n[Researcher Lorri is seen watering various plants in the Site-78 greenhouse including SCP-7560]\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Ahhhhhhhhhhh!

Throw me a bone.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Well even if I could tell you, which I can't because my name is a forbidden spell too RADICAL for mere mortals to speak. It's unpronounceable by human tongue. Only radishes can speak it.\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** But you're the only talking radish.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** You just can't hear the other radishes but I can. Trust me, they are a boring bunch and not nearly as RAD as I.\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** (Chuckles) Oh I'm sure, perhaps we can come up with a nickname for you. I never really thought just being a number might wear on you a bit.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** It's de-RADISH-izing! But I understand that it's just a part of your job. You give things numbers, I find things underground. We're all put on this Earth to do what we're best at.\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** Well I don't just give numbers to things, I'm.... well.... I don't really know what I'm good at. I like botany and engineering but I've never really fit in with the people at this site.

The purpose of the Initiative is to hopefully lower the monetary costs relating to the Foundation's current budget (a memo explaining the circumstances of [[[scp-6004|Incident 6004-MONGOOSE]]] has been attached to this notice).\n\n\u00a0\n\nA Site-01 liaison has been transferred and assigned to each individual Foundation facility to ensure that the proper personnel maintains the preservation of the EVERSOR Initiative. Keep in mind that the Initiative has been classed as a Class-V Priority in the SCP Foundation Dogma.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe thank you for your cooperation and understanding.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7560.03:** Eversor Initiative Audit of Site-78\n\n\n\nOn November 2nd of 2022, an audit was performed by Site-78's EVERSOR liaison into the growing budget being allotted to Site-78. The following is a transcription of the meeting between Site Director Leah Richter and specialist Kaibert Samson.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n[Begin Recording]\n\n\n\n**Samson:** The day is November 2nd, 2022 this is Specialist Samson, Site-01 liaison to Site-78. Director, please state your name for the record.\n\n\n\n**Richter:** Site-78 Director Leah Erin Richter, reporting for a financial audit of my facility. What exactly did you want to discuss in this meeting?\n\n\n\n**Samson:** Well Director, it has come to the attention of the O5 Council that over the past year, this Site has become a large sink of Foundation resources in your ongoing efforts to contain the Set of Nine[[footnote]] Anomalous set of books marked by roman numerals [[/footnote]].\n\n\n\n**Richter:** I wouldn't put it in such a negative way like that. It's not our fault that we keep requesting so much time and money but with repairs still ongoing from the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6419 attack] by the Chaos Insurgency and our efforts to better our MTF through the creation of SCP-6952 derived weaponry; you can see how things get expensive.\n\n\n\n**Samson:** Believe me, I meant nothing negative by it. Your site is to be commended for containing so many anomalies in the past year. You've also struck quite a blow against GoIs such as the Volk Division and keeping groups like Gamers against Weed in check.\n\n\n\n**Richter:** Gamers against Weed has been a bit of a thorn in the side of our Pataphysics department but we're trying our best to keep the realm of fiction safe.\n\n\n\n**Samson:** The O5 Council agrees which is why I am here to cut down on spending. This way more resources can be allocated to containing the Set.\n\n\n\n**Richter:** What are you proposing?\n\n\n\n**Samson:** The Greenhouse project here at Site-78. It was a novel thing to have for producing food and doing plant research but ultimately it's non-essential. Thus it's being cut as well as the anomaly you have stored there... SCP-7560? Correct?\n\n\n\n**Richter:** Sir, SCP-7560 is a valuable tool for finding anomalous resources. We can't just neutralize it like that. I would argue that it would waste more money to get rid of it.\n\n\n\n**Samson:** We've done the projections, Director. You already have plenty of 6952-2 materials at this site to produce all the weapons you may need. SCP-7560 has served its purpose. You can continue collecting more through the usual means.\n\n\n\n**Richter:** Specialist Samson, it's a radish. We can just move it into another containment cell or it can sit in one of our office spaces. I don't see why-\n\n\n\n**Samson:** Cost is cost, Director Richter. Your researchers and the MTF assigned to it have better things to do than babysitting a Radish. We need to save on everything, no matter how trivial. Assign one of your Researchers to handle the neutralization and we'll take care of dismantling the greenhouse. Do I make myself clear?\n\n\n\n**Richter:** I will put Researcher Chudley on it, I would have Lorri do it but I feel that she may have grown attached to the thing.\n\n\n\n[End Recording]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum 7560.04:** Neutralization of SCP-7560\n\n\n\nOn November 4th, 2022 SCP-7560 was scheduled for neutralization. Researcher Chudley brought SCP-7560 to the firing range to be disposed of. Research Lorri was allowed to watch but not interfere with the process. The following is a video log of the event.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n\n[Begin Recording]\n\n\n\n[Researcher Chudley is seen placing SCP-7560 into a slingshot while Researcher Johnston stands by preparing her Gauss Rifle[[footnote]] SCP-6952 derived weapon.

I'm gonna blow into a million pieces, it's gonna be RADICAL!\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** There has to be a more convenient way to do this. We don't just... shoot anomalies.\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** Look, your radish friend here is tough and I mean like really tough. And that Samson guy is REALLY Adamant about saving money so we have to use inexpensive methods. Johnston did the math and found from our data on SCP-7560's..... escapades, that one Gauss Rifle shot should do it.\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** You just really want to see him blow up, don't you?\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** That's besides the point.\n\n\n\n**Lorri:** (sighs) I'm gonna miss you buddy, it was nice having you around for a little while.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** You may have been my captor Lorri, but damn if you weren't RAD! Before I go though, did you figure out what you were put here for?\n\n\n\n**Lorri:**\u00a0\u00a0To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just supposed to be here for the ones that need it.\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** Aww your gonna break a radish's heart. Alright Johnston I'm READY!\n\n\n\n**Johnston:** So am I. Chudley, you good?\n\n\n\n**Chudley:** I am.\n\n\n\n[Chudley pulls back the slingshot and yells \"Pull!\", SCP-7560 goes flying into the air and Johnston takes aim with her rifle.]\n\n\n\n**SCP-7560:** THIS IS THE MOST RADICAL DAY OF MY LI-\n\n\n\n[SCP-7560 explodes into a shower of radish juices as Johnston hits her target.]\n\n\n\n[End Recording]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nAfter this event, SCP-7560's remains were determined to be non-anomalous and its containment class was updated from Safe to Decommissioned.\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n----\n\n[[div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n<< **[[[SCP-7297]]]** | **EVERSOR: Phase I** | **[[[SCP-7072]]]** >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n\n<< [[[SCP-7559]]] | SCP-7560| [[[SCP-7561]]] >>\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:wikimodule\">:scp-wiki:component:wikimodule</a> |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box</a>]]\n\n=====\n\n> **Name:** Radish 3371103037 4ab07db0bf o\n\n> **Author:** Jengod\n\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Radish_3371103037_4ab07db0bf_o.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n=====\n\n[[include <a href=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:license-box-end\">:scp-wiki:component:license-box-end</a>]]\n", "references": ["sytycfanon", "classification-committee-memo", "scp-6952", "scp-7175", "scp-7000", "scp-6296", "scp-6004", "scp-6419", "scp-7297", "scp-7072", "scp-7559", "scp-7561", "scp-2704", "scp-7261", "scp-5938", "scp-7975", "scp-7110", "scp-6187", "scp-4230", "scp-3452", "scp-7233", "scp-7682", "scp-7899", "scp-7970", "revelations-of-the-author", "aar-5950-osaka", "lost-souls-broken-toys-chapter-2", "the-raven-of-cyberspace", "lost-souls-broken-toys-chapter-1", "a-very-otamatone-christmas", "love-in-the-time-of-chugwater", "raven-of-cyberspace-ii-shadowheist", "the-site-78-halloween-special", "aar-7890-logovo-volka", "a-tale-of-two-chugwaters", "licensing-guide", "licensing-master-list"], "scp": "SCP-7560", "scp_number": 7560, "series": "decommissioned", "tags": ["_cc", "_licensebox", "autonomous", "decommissioned", "food", "greg-chudley", "maria-johnston", "ninth-world", "predictive", "sapient", "scp"], "title": "SCP-7560", "url": "https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7560"}, "SCP-7791": {"created_at": "2023-03-17T12:20:00", "creator": "NielleiN", "domain": "scp-wiki.wikidot.com", "history": [{"author": "NielleiN", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/niellein", "comment": "", "date": "2023-03-17T12:20:00"}, {"author": "NielleiN", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/niellein", "comment": "", "date": "2023-03-17T12:40:00"}, {"author": "narm00", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/narm00", "comment": "Changed 'performed' to 'perform'", "date": "2023-03-19T08:57:00"}, {"author": "NielleiN", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/niellein", "comment": "Parent page set to: \"site-17-hub\".", "date": "2023-03-20T12:37:00"}, {"author": "Nipixel_Paxel", "author_href": "http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/nipixel-paxel", "comment": "Added tags: concept, decommissioned, deepwell-catalog, ethics-committee, scp.
